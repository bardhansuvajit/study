AWS with LARAVEL

1. Repository
2. Docker
3. AWS CLI


** Repository
github, private x 2 repo
    1. project-title
    2. project-title-base-image


** Docker
in local environment, 'database' image is needed
in production environment, for database, 'AWS RDS' will be used, so no 'database' container is needed


** AWS CLI
to manage AWS services. To authenticate local env with AWS Elastic container repo, which is used to store Docker images
to install -> google 'aws cli install' -> follow steps (for windows, goto wsl2 container)

to verify -> 
which aws > returns > /usr/local/bin/aws
aws --version > returns > aws-cli/2.19.1 Python/3.11.6 Darwin/23.3.0 botocore/2.4.5


** Pre deployment preparation
@docker compose stop
@docker build --no-cache
@docker compose up --force-recreate -d

.env.prod > APP_ENV=prod, APP_DEBUG=false, APP_URL=https://domainname.com, 


** AWS Account (Credit/ debit card required)
Create new account/ login > aws.amazon.in > goto Console


** Domain registration + DNS management
Route 53 - DNS servers respond to queries on port 53 and provide answers that route end users to your applications on the Internet.
1 `Register domain` from AWS 
OR
2 Transfer other domain to AWS
2.1 Go to `Hosted zones` > Create
domain name, public hosted zone > SAVE

Records might be created (total 4 records needed as per multiple videos - 2 records have to create and 2 will be created automatically)

2.2 Get IP from EC2 > instances > IPV4 IP (If not set, Set Elastic IP first)

2.3 Create record > Simple routing > Define simple record
OR
Create record > Record type - A - Routes traffic to IPV4 address > use IPV4 IP in value > SAVE

Define another simple record

Add 'www' to Record name > Add 'domain name' in value > Recored type - CNAME > SAVE & CREATE RECORDS

2.4 Use 4 DNS from AWS & update Name-servers them to Domain providers (Like GoDaddy/ others)
DONOT COPY 'last .' From AWS DNS



** ELASTIC IP ADDRESS
to maintain a consistent address via IP even if instance is stopped or restarted
EC2 > Network > Elastic IP
Allocate new IP address > AMazon's pool of IPV4 address > Add a name too > Get the IP address

The IP could be used in domain registration



** SECURITY GROUP
this acts like a virtual firewall that controlls inbound and outbound traffic
EC2 > Network > Security group

Create new > name: public website internet access, desc: open ports 443 & 80 to allow http & https connection to our server >
Add 2 inbound rules > type: http & https, source: anywhere > SAVE

Create new again > name: dev ssh access, desc: allow ssh access for devs
inbound > type: ssh, source: my IP > SAVE

Also name them from the listing page if required



** RDS INSTANCE
seperate database server instead of running on same server where we serve the website (expensive)
try to create a tiny instance with minimal usage. in case the server usage exceeds a certain threshold, use cloud watch

RDS > create database > standard create > mysql > desired mysql version > production template > provide name 'productsion-database'/ some-other-name  > username 'admin'/ auto generate password * > smallest instance class, Burstable class & select DB micro > storage, general purpose > public access, NO > 

** to use the new database, we need these 3
instance endpoint
- can be found in RDS > databases, select identifier > under connectivity & security, Endpoint is available
master user
- can be found in RDS > databases, select identifier > under configuration, availability, master username is available
password
- was auto generated, will be shown once after the instance is created OR just modify it & add new master password


** EC2 INSTANCE - Linux Ubuntu Server
EC2 > instances > Launch instance > Ububtu server > instance type, t2 micro, free tier > 
auto aasign [ublic IP, disable it, since we are using elastic IP
security group, mark those we just create
review & launch
to connect to instances we need key-pair value/ pem file > create new key pair > use domain name/ other as key pair name > download key pair
Launch Instance

later, edit the name with your domain name, from the Instance list

* Now, map server with the elastic ip
setup Elastic IP > Action, Associate Elastic IP  > select Instance > Associate
Back to Instances, refresh, check the server gets assigned to Public IPv4 address, copy it


** Export Website - Gathering Requirements
