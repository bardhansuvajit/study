1 DEFINITION
Docker lets u build and run projects in containers. It's a platform for developing, shipping and running your application.
Typically when u build/ host a laravel project, u need minimum these 3 components installed - a server, a database and php. 
With docker u can build a container for each component
Once u create Docker build for your project, u can use it to rebuild your project on any other computer without spending any time configuring your server manually


2 INSTALL
Download docker + WSL2
> docker -v                     - check in terminal for docker version
Settings to check > Enable WSL2 based engine + Enable Docker compose v2


3 COMMANDS
> docker ps                     - shows status of all running containers on Docker Engine, including this project
> dcker-compose ps              - shows status of specific running containers of a project


4 FILES
create a laravel project first
root_directory > Dockerfile + docker-compose.yaml (/ .yml both are same. but try to use .yaml for standardization)
root_directory > Docker (folder) > entrypoint.sh


5 DATABASE CONTAINER
first container to run mysql server
** docker-compose.yaml >
# version: "3.8"                                    # used in earlier versions

services:
    # Database server
    database:                                       # any name
        image: mysql:8.0
        ports:                                      # expose ports to connect to database container
            - 3306:3306                             # host machine port 3306 is mapped to container port 3306
        environment:
            - MYSQL_DATABASE=${DB_DATABASE}         # dynamic from .env
            # - MYSQL_UESR=${DB_USERNAME}           # used in earlier versions
            - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
            - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
        volumes:
            - db-data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
    db-data: ~                                      # any name


> docker-compose up --build     - Build the container now
> docker-compose ps             - check status
in case of any errors, try fix them
> docker-sompose down           - stop running containers, in case any are running, optional step
rebuild containers using, docker-compose up --build
