Laravel 
> Open source PHP framework
> follows MVC architechture, which seperates logic with presentation
> has a lot of ecosystems (Breeze, Fortify, Passport, Horizon etc) for further development

> Prerequisites - PHP, OOP, Namespaces & autoloading, composer, arrays, files, GET/ POST, PDO, cookies/ sessions, GIT, apache/ nginix, html, css, javascript
> Curve - Setup, MVC, Architechture, Directory, Artisan, Tinker, Routing, Controller, Middleware, SErvice container, Service provider, Facades, Views, Blade, Layouts, Components, Asset bundling, Migration, Query builder, Collections, Models, Eloquent ORM, Relationship, Pagination, Jobs, Queue, Authentication, AUthorization, Security, Form request, Command scheduling, Caching, File system

Setup/ Install Locally
Laravel Herd - does not use docker
Laravel Sail - uses docker, to setup Laravel development environment
* Docker - allows us to package an application, along with dependencies, into a container that makes easy to develope, ship & run ithe application consistently accross all environments
Other tools to install Laravel Locally are Laragon, Xampp etc.

We will be using Laravel Sail (https://laravel.com/docs/11.x#sail-on-windows)
> ** Need Docker Desktop & WSL2 enabled (to enable Ubuntu in Command prompt, install ubuntu, wsl --install -d ubuntu/ wsl --install ubuntu)
> Goto Powershell, begin a new terminal session for ubuntu

> curl -s https://laravel.build/laravel-sail | bash
> cd laravel-sail
> explorer.exe ./ open .            // to visit where the files are installed in explorer
> code .                            // open vs code terminal & change to ubuntu
> ./vendor/bin/sail up -d           // this command is like, docker compose up/ -d is detached mode, meaning the containers will run in background
> laravel-sail can also be found inside Docker Container

Check 'docker-compose.yml' file, when we do sail up, these rae the containers that start running
Laravel sail uses PHP's built-in server, does not use nginix/ fpm

> visit localhost                   // http://localhost:8025/ for mailbox port
> * in case of DB error, change connection to sqlite OR do DB migration again
> ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate


## MVC ARCHITECHTURE
Seperates data and business logic from presentation, makes cleaner, modular code, easier to debug & scale

Model
Business logic + Data + Data management + Queries  | Generally communicate with Controller, but sometimes View as well
View
Presentation (HTML, CSS, JS) | Blade template engine
Controller
Between Model & View | Handles user requests, handles them by talking to Models, sends data back to browser by loading the View

** EXAMPLE of Laravel's request lifecycle
While subimiting a form in Laravel, the request > Router > Middlewares > Controller > Validate > Interact with Model > Prepares response > presented to user by Views


## REQUEST LIFESTYLE/ FOLDER ARCHITECHTURE
1.  entry point for all web request are inside public/ index.php
    > index.php is the document root that is configured in web server, like apache/ nginix
    > what does the script say, according to the code
        > it first checks if the application is in maintenance mode & handles it accordingly
        > next, it registers the composer autoloader (../vendor/autoload.php), which allows laravel to load all necessary classes
        > finally it loads the application from ../bootstrap/app.php, which sets up & configures everything the app needs to run
2. app.php
    > once the Application object is created & sent to index.php, then handleRequest() is called (can be found inside Application.php)
    > handleRequest() takes incoming HTTP request using Kernel & converts it into response after running through the application's logic
    > Kernel is a contract/ interface (can be found inside Http/Kernel.php)
    > Now, inside Kernel.php, goto handle()
    > Now, the request is passed through Router, SendRequestThroughRouter(), inside the method, the bootstrap() method is called. the request is sent thorugh Middleware & dispatched into Router
        > the bootstrap method is responsible for cofiguring & bootstrapping important part like error handling, logins etc.
        > Start up process/ Bootstrapping involves setting up service providers, which are like helpers that get everything, like database, queues, routing, validation ready for the app to run properly
        > $bootstrapers can be found in Kernel, they configures & start up the application. Like regsiterProviders, 
    > Middlewares acts as filters to requests, can be applied globally or to specific routes
    > then it's sent to prepare response

Console requests enters the application through the artisan CLI, which bootstraps the application using console kernel, not by public/ index.php
    > these commands are called Artisan commands & they are handled by the artisan file in root directory
    > the artisan file is same as public/ index.php but instead of handleRequest(), it uses handleCommand()
    > handleCommand() can be found inside foundation/console/kernel.php

* Kernels directing how requests are handled, whether they are web requests/ console commands
* first the services/ classes are registered/ bind into the service containers, then booted by boot method, which is action method
* Service Container != Service Provider


## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
app - contains core code
    > Http - request related logic
        > Controllers
        > Middlewares
        > Forn Requests
    > Models - eloquent model classes (Eloquent is Laravel ORM)
    > Providers - helps bootstrap the application (means, setting up the environment and initializing necessary components)
        > AppServiceProvider.php
        > & other custom service providers
bootstrap
    > Cache - contains cached framework generated files
    > app.php - responsible for bootstrapping the framwork
config - app config files
database
    > factories - testing for unit & feature test
    > migrations - db schema related files
    > seeders - testing for unit & feature test
public - document root & also contains assets like images, css, js
    > index.php - the initial request go through here
resources - contains uncompiled assets & views
routes - contains web routes & console based commands
    > api.php - if app provides REST API
storage - app logs, files generated by the framework, if u dont use AWS S3, the some files can be stored here
tests - unit & feature tests
vendor - contains composer files


## ARTISAN COMMAND
its laravel's command line interface
atrisan file in laravel's directory. its a php file
php artisan list - to see all commands

** now, if docker is used in a project, running 'php artisan...' wont work, it would say php not found
we have to run it in the docker container, wher php is actually installed. so try this...
> ./vendor/bin/sail artisan list

to directly connect to container from terminal/ run bash shell session, use,
> docker exec -it [container_name] bash

another way to open a shell, using laravel sail
> ./vendor/bin/sail shell

php artisan route:list          // remember, route is the namespace, try php artisan route, 
                                // this command shows all application routes & all registered routes within vendor directory. there might be some packages, which have their own routes. to see only application routes, php artisan route:list --except-vendor
php artisan config:cache -h     // -h is help, shows description of the command


## TINKER
run php code in terminal, to debug/ experiment/ interact the laravel application directly from the CLI. we can do these by using the tool, called Tinker. 
> Tinker is a REPL, which is a n environment where user inputs are read and evaluted
> PHP uses PsySH REPL. Tinker is powered by PsySH
> So what happenes, when tinker is started, it boots up laravel application interacting with it's service container.
> to start Tinker session/ enter its environment, use `./vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker` OR `./vendor/bin/sail tinker`

> example: create a page app/PaymentService.php > function process() {echo 'paid';} > restart tinker session (doesnt support hot reload) > try $paymentService = new app\PaymentService() > $paymentService->process() > paid

> in Tinker, we can type `down` or `up` to put or remove the applicationin maintenance mode
> to config the tinker file, `./vendor/bin/sail artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Tinker\TinkerServiceProvider"`
& the config file will be available as config/tinker.php. here we can write additional tinker commands


## CONFIG FILE
app.php     > application configuration files, uses variable values from .env file. to check all environment variables, goto tinker, type $_ENV superglobal, check for env('APP_NAME')/ env('SOME_UNDEFINED_VARIABLE') > null/ env('SOME_UNDEFINED_VARIABLE', 'SOME VALUE') > SOME VALUE
> other commands like, App::environment > local/ App::environment('staging') > false/ App::isProduction > false
> we can also create custom configuration file, just a basic php file, just try returning an array. to access it, use config('custom.key'), config helper function/ Config::get('custom.key'), config facades
> we can also set value by Config::set('custom.key', 'some value')

Caching
> configuration files are cahched to boost performance. so if the .env file is updated, it might not show properly. to cache config files, `php artisan config:cache` OR `./vendor/bin/sail config:cache`
> to clear config cache, run, `php artisan config:clear` OR `./vendor/bin/sail config:clear`. Try not to cache cofiguration files locally as we keep changing values. better cache them in production
> cached files can be found in bootstrap/cache/config.php. this file has a large array. when cleared, this file is deleted

local env
> we can set local env by creating .env.local file & use APP_ENV=local php artisan tinker/ php artisan tinker --env=local, check for config('app.name')

other configuration files
> laravel had other config files but now they are limited, to generate them, `php artisan config:publish`, a list will appear & u choose your file, like hashing & u can see/ use/ edit them as per need
> if other libraries, like tinker, has their own config files, u can edit them too, like
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Tinker\TinkerServiceProvider"
> if the generated files are not needed anymore, simply delete them


## ROUTING
takes a request, maps it to action, returns response back
routes folder > console.php, stores closure based command & web .php stores aplication's http routes
in route file/ web.php while assigning a route, we can 
    send the route to a view, return view('home.index') 
    or return text, return 'sample text'
    or return array, return ['gio', 'tony', 'josh']

laravel's route supports multiple type of HTTP requests, match, any...
Route::get('/path', function() {
    return 'hello world';
})
Route::match(['get', 'post'], '/another-path', function() {...})
Route::any('/another-path', function() {...})

Route::redirect('/uri1', '/uri2')

php artisan route:list - shows all routes
there's a up route defined in bootstrap/app.php, a vendor route
php artisan route:list --except-vendor
php artisan route:list --only-vendor

php artisan route:list --path=dashboard - shows all dashboard related routes

php artisan route:cache - cache routes
php artisan route:clear - clear route cacche


## ROUTE PARAMETERS
Route::get('/transactions/{transactionId}', function($transactionId) {
    return 'Showing transaction details '.$transactionId;
});

** parameter order matters
Route::get('/transactions/{transactionId}/files/{fileId}', function($transactionId, $fileId) {
    return 'Showing file id '.fileId.' for transaction details '.$transactionId;
});
** optional parameter '?'
Route::get('/report/{year}/{month?}', function($year, $month = null) {
    return 'Generating report for '.$year.$month;
});

> Query string parameters is also an option, route/567?year=2024&month=10

** Dependency Injection in route
Routes night also have dependencies other than route parameters like $year, $month.
Laravel allows us to inject classes in route actions, whether its controller/ function callback & the service container automatically resolves them.

Ex - a most common dependency we inject within route actions, is Request class. we can access the parameters using the request class
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/report/{reportId}', function(Request $request, int $reportId) {
    $year = $request->get('year');
    $month = $request->get('month');

    return 'Generating report '.$reportId.' for '.$year.' '.$month;
})
There are other ways to get the params value, rather than using the dependency injection Request class. but this is better

> regular expression
Route::get('/transactions/{transactionId}', function(int $transactionId) {
    return $id;
})->where('transactionId', '[0-9]+');
which makes sure transactionId is always sent integer.

where([
    'transactionId' => '[0-9]+',
    'fileId' => '[0-9]+'
]);
OR
whereNumber(['transactionId', 'fileId'])
OR
> we can also globally define the regular expressions
AppServiceProvider > boot() method >
Route::pattern('transactionId', '[0-9]+');
Route::pattern('fileId', '[0-9]+');
AND
whereIn('fileType', ['receipt', 'statement'])

mismatch in these rules, redirects to 404 page

** enum type
app > Enums (create) > FileType.php (create)
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\Enums;
enum FileType: string {
    case Receipt = 'receipt';
    case Statement = 'statement';
}

change in route
Route::get('/...', function(int $transactionId, string $filetype) {     // pass FileType instead of string type
    return $filetype->value;
})->whereIn('fileType', ['receipt', 'statement'])                       // also whereIn can be removed
