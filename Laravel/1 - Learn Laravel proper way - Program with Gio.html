Laravel 
> Open source PHP framework
> follows MVC architechture, which seperates logic with presentation
> has a lot of ecosystems (Breeze, Fortify, Passport, Horizon etc) for further development

> Prerequisites - PHP, OOP, Namespaces & autoloading, composer, arrays, files, GET/ POST, PDO, cookies/ sessions, GIT, apache/ nginix, html, css, javascript
> Curve - Setup, MVC, Architechture, Directory, Artisan, Tinker, Routing, Controller, Middleware, SErvice container, Service provider, Facades, Views, Blade, Layouts, Components, Asset bundling, Migration, Query builder, Collections, Models, Eloquent ORM, Relationship, Pagination, Jobs, Queue, Authentication, AUthorization, Security, Form request, Command scheduling, Caching, File system

Setup/ Install Locally
Laravel Herd - does not use docker
Laravel Sail - uses docker, to setup Laravel development environment
* Docker - allows us to package an application, along with dependencies, into a container that makes easy to develope, ship & run ithe application consistently accross all environments
Other tools to install Laravel Locally are Laragon, Xampp etc.

We will be using Laravel Sail (https://laravel.com/docs/11.x#sail-on-windows)
> ** Need Docker Desktop & WSL2 enabled (to enable Ubuntu in Command prompt, install ubuntu, wsl --install -d ubuntu/ wsl --install ubuntu)
> Goto Powershell, begin a new terminal session for ubuntu

> curl -s https://laravel.build/laravel-sail | bash
> cd laravel-sail
> explorer.exe ./ open .            // to visit where the files are installed in explorer
> code .                            // open vs code terminal & change to ubuntu
> ./vendor/bin/sail up -d           // this command is like, docker compose up/ -d is detached mode, meaning the containers will run in background
> laravel-sail can also be found inside Docker Container

Check 'docker-compose.yml' file, when we do sail up, these rae the containers that start running
Laravel sail uses PHP's built-in server, does not use nginix/ fpm

> visit localhost                   // http://localhost:8025/ for mailbox port
> * in case of DB error, change connection to sqlite OR do DB migration again
> ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate


MVC Architechture
Seperates data and business logic from presentation, makes cleaner, modular code, easier to debug & scale

Model
Business logic + Data + Data management + Queries  | Generally communicate with Controller, but sometimes View as well
View
Presentation (HTML, CSS, JS) | Blade template engine
Controller
Between Model & View | Handles user requests, handles them by talking to Models, sends data back to browser by loading the View

** EXAMPLE of Laravel's request lifecycle
While subimiting a form in Laravel, the request > Router > Middlewares > Controller > Validate > Interact with Model > Prepares response > presented to user by Views


Laravel folder architechture
1.  entry point for all web request are inside public/ index.php
    > index.php is the document root that is configured in web server, like apache/ nginix
    > what does the script say, according to the code
        > it first checks if the application is in maintenance mode & handles it accordingly
        > next, it registers the composer autoloader (../vendor/autoload.php), which allows laravel to load all necessary classes
        > finally it loads the application from ../bootstrap/app.php, which sets up & configures everything the app needs to run
2. app.php
    > once the Application object is created & sent to index.php, then handleRequest() is called (can be found inside Application.php)
    > handleRequest() takes incoming HTTP request using Kernel & converts it into response after running through the application's logic
    > Kernel is a contract/ interface (can be found inside Http/Kernel.php)
    > Now, inside Kernel.php, goto handle()
    > Now, the request is passed through Router, SendRequestThroughRouter(), inside the method, the bootstrap() method is called. the request is sent thorugh Middleware & dispatched into Router
        > the bootstrap method is responsible for cofiguring & bootstrapping important part like error handling, logins etc.
        > Start up process/ Bootstrapping involves setting up service providers, which are like helpers that get everything, like database, queues, routing, validation ready for the app to run properly
        > $bootstrapers can be found in Kernel, they configures & start up the application. Like regsiterProviders, 
    > Middlewares acts as filters to requests, can be applied globally or to specific routes
    > then it's sent to prepare response

Console requests enters the application through the artisan CLI, which bootstraps the application using console kernel, not by public/ index.php
    > these commands are called Artisan commands & they are handled by the artisan file in root directory
    > the artisan file is same as public/ index.php but instead of handleRequest(), it uses handleCommand()
    > handleCommand() can be found inside foundation/console/kernel.php

* Kernels directing how requests are handled, whether they are web requests/ console commands

* first the services/ classes are registered/ bind into the service containers, then booted by boot method, which is action method

* Service Container != Service Provider
