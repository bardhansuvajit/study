STEPS
create Laravel app > Dockerise it > install composer packages > run tests inside docker container > install Jenkins > Jenkins CI/CD pipeline > pipeline will spin up the docker containers, run tests > create ARtifact, Zip the app, populate .env, then copy the artifact over AWS EC2 instance > unzip there & app will be available




BASICS
Docker
What: A containerization platform that packages an application and its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.
Why: Ensures consistent environments, easy deployment, faster setup, and scalability.

Jenkins
What: An open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy applications.
Why: Automates repetitive DevOps tasks and acts as the backbone for CI/CD pipelines.

CI/CD
CI (Continuous Integration): Developers frequently merge code; automated builds/tests run to catch issues early.
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment): Automates releasing code to staging/production after CI passes.
Why: Improves code quality, reduces manual errors, speeds up releases, and ensures reliable deployments.




PROBLEM
Deployment takes time. once the app is live, doing changes after that is hectic. like pulling repo, install packages, dependencies, testing etc in live is scary
OR, use a machine into a Build Machine




INSTALL PACKAGES
use Manjaro distro for linux, IF POSSIBLE

update packages - 
sudo pacman -Su (pacman is the package manager -su means sync & upgrade installed packages) (OR sudo pacman -Syu)

install snap repository
sudo pacman -S snapd (installs snapd from the official Arch/Manjaro software repository.)

enable snap repo
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket (enable → makes the service start automatically on boot | --now → start immediately | snapd.socket → the socket unit that triggers the Snap daemon when needed)

create a symlink (symlink is a pointer or shortcut to another file or folder.)
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap (creates a shortcut from /var/lib/snapd/snap to /snap so Snap apps can run normally on system)

install VScode, google vscode snap
sudo snap install code --classic

installing Docker through pacman
sudo pacman -S docker
enable & start the docker service
sudo systemctl start docker.service
sudo systemctl enable docker.service

now docker has created a group, add current logged-in user needs to be in the group 
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

install docker compose, which is a separate application here
sudo pacman -S docker-compose

sudo reboot



PROJECT BOILERPLATE
get dockerfiles & docker-compose.yml from here
https://github.com/thecaringdeveloper/laravel-cicd-tutorial

mkdir workspace > cd workspace > git clone... > cd demo-project
docker compose up - now the containers are running
install laravel app now
docker-compose run composer create-project laravel/laravel some-project-name "8.0.*" --prefer-dist

NOW, 
demo-project
    |---dockerfiles
    |---docker-compose.yml
    |---some-project-name (laravel app)
move everything from "some-project-name" to "demo-project" folder
mv ./some-project-name/* ./ (move all files)
mv ./some-project-name/.* ./ (move hidden files)
rm -rf some-project-name

test if everything is working
docker-compose run artisan test




INSTALL JAVA & JENKINS & SETUP ADMIN ACCOUNT
JAVA
sudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk-headless jre8-openjdk jdk8-openjdk openjdk8-doc openjdk8-src
JENKINS
sudo pacman -S jenkins, if doesnt work, update packages first, sudo pacman -Sy (OR sudo pacman -Syu)
start jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins

to check goto, the page will ask for initialAdminPassword
http://localhost:8090

to get the initialAdminPassword
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword (u can get this path from jenkins page)
copy & use the password > install suggested plugins > create admin user > 'admin' & 'admin', test email & name, keep the URL same http://localhost:8090 > Jenkins dashboard

Jenkins is a tool to create pipelines, deploy, run tests etc.




GIHUB REPO SETUP
create new repo > private
set new repo in local
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:bardhansuvajit/laravel-ci-cd-project.git
git config --global user.email bardhansuvajit@gmail.com
git config --global user.name suvajit
git add *
git commit -m 'laravel project'
git push




ADD JENKINS USER TO DOCKER GROUP
that will ensure the jenkins user can control the docker containers
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins

create jenkins file & create ci/cd pipeline in jenkins. these pipeline will find the jenkins file inside github repo and will be used to drive the ci/cd pipeline
