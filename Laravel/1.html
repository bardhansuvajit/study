Setup/ Install Locally
Laravel Herd - does not use docker
Laravel Sail - uses docker, to setup Laravel development environment
* Docker - allows us to package an application, along with dependencies, into a container that makes easy to develope, ship & run ithe application consistently accross all environments
Other tools to install Laravel Locally are Laragon, Xampp etc.

We will be using Laravel Sail (https://laravel.com/docs/11.x#sail-on-windows)
> ** Need Docker Desktop & WSL2 enabled (to enable Ubuntu in Command prompt, install ubuntu, wsl --install -d ubuntu/ wsl --install ubuntu)
> Goto Powershell, begin a new terminal session for ubuntu

> curl -s https://laravel.build/laravel-sail | bash
> cd laravel-sail
> ./vendor/bin/sail up -d           // this command is like, docker compose up/ -d is detached mode, meaning the containers will run in background
> code .
> explorer.exe .                    // to visit where the files are installed in explorer

Check 'docker-compose.yml' file, when we do sail up, these rae the containers that start running
Laravel sail uses PHP's built-in server, does not use nginix/ fpm
