Laravel 
> Open source PHP framework
> follows MVC architechture, which seperates logic with presentation
> has a lot of ecosystems (Breeze, Fortify, Passport, Horizon etc) for further development

> Prerequisites - PHP, OOP, Namespaces & autoloading, composer, arrays, files, GET/ POST, PDO, cookies/ sessions, GIT, apache/ nginix, html, css, javascript
> Curve - Setup, MVC, Architechture, Directory, Artisan, Tinker, Routing, Controller, Middleware, SErvice container, Service provider, Facades, Views, Blade, Layouts, Components, Asset bundling, Migration, Query builder, Collections, Models, Eloquent ORM, Relationship, Pagination, Jobs, Queue, Authentication, AUthorization, Security, Form request, Command scheduling, Caching, File system

Setup/ Install Locally
Laravel Herd - does not use docker
Laravel Sail - uses docker, to setup Laravel development environment
* Docker - allows us to package an application, along with dependencies, into a container that makes easy to develope, ship & run ithe application consistently accross all environments
Other tools to install Laravel Locally are Laragon, Xampp etc.

We will be using Laravel Sail (https://laravel.com/docs/11.x#sail-on-windows)
> ** Need Docker Desktop & WSL2 enabled (to enable Ubuntu in Command prompt, install ubuntu, wsl --install -d ubuntu/ wsl --install ubuntu)
> Goto Powershell, begin a new terminal session for ubuntu

> curl -s https://laravel.build/laravel-sail | bash
> cd laravel-sail
> explorer.exe .                    // to visit where the files are installed in explorer
> code .                            // open vs code terminal & change to ubuntu
> ./vendor/bin/sail up -d           // this command is like, docker compose up/ -d is detached mode, meaning the containers will run in background
> laravel-sail can also be found inside Docker Container

Check 'docker-compose.yml' file, when we do sail up, these rae the containers that start running
Laravel sail uses PHP's built-in server, does not use nginix/ fpm

> visit localhost                   // http://localhost:8025/ for mailbox port
> * in case of DB error, change connection to sqlite OR do DB migration again
> ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate


MVC Architechture
Seperates data and business logic from presentation, makes cleaner, modular code, easier to debug & scale

Model           Business logic + Data + Data management + Queries  | Generally communicate with Controller, but sometimes View as well
View            Presentation (HTML, CSS, JS) | Blade template engine
Controller      Between Model & View | Handles user requests, handles them by talking to Models, sends data back to browser by loading the View

EXAMPLE
While subimiting a form in Laravel, the request > Router > Middlewares > Controller > Validate > Interact with Model > Prepares response > presented to user by Views
