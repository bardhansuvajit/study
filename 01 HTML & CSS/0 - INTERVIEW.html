=======================================================================
==================*************** HTML ***************=================
=======================================================================

HTML
- Hypertext (Text with reference/ text that can be accessed) Markup (used TAGS to mark language) Language

IDE
- integrated (together) delelopment environment, like vs code, sublime text, 
- increases productivity, code auutocomplete, syntax highlight, error check

API
    Application Programming Interface - used to communicate with different systems
    REST API - Representational State Transfer - Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) - uses JSON data format
    SOAP API - Simple Object Access Protocol - XML-based, very strict and formal - Often used in banking/ enterprise/ legacy systems - Old web services or government APIs
    GraphQL API - created by Facebook - Client can request exact data needed - Efficient &  flexible, especially in modern apps
    gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) - very fast, uses binary format (Protocol Buffers) - Ideal for microservices

HTML || XML || XHTML
    HTML for most websites.
    XML when storing or sharing data. (eXtensible Markup Language)
        some old/ enterprise systems still send data in XML, like SOAP APIs
        Many apps/tools use XML for configuration (e.g., Android AndroidManifest.xml, VS Code settings).
        JSON replaced XML
    XHTML only if required to follow strict standards. (eXtensible HTML)
        Some older sites still use XHTML 1.0 Strict or Transitional.
        HTML5 replaced XHML

HTML list
- orderred, unordered & definition (dl/dt/dd - Definition List/ Definition Term/ Definition Description)

Meta tag
    provides additional info about website - like, author, desc, keyword

HTML || HTML 5
    needed Flash/ plugins to work with audio/ video file || built in audio & video tags
    used div always || uses semantic tags <header> <main> <footer> for better understanding
    only input type text & password supported || new types, date email range etc

!DOCTYPE
    "DOCTYPE" = Document Type. 
    When declared, it means, this document is type - HTML5. Browser will render it using modern rules
    Helps the browser avoid quirks mode. Uses Standard mode

** Quirks Mode || Standards mode || Almost Standards Mode (Browser modes)
‚úÖ Standards Mode -         Follows modern HTML/CSS rules (triggered by <!DOCTYPE html>)
üü° Quirks Mode -            Uses old, forgiving rules (if DOCTYPE is missing or wrong)
üîµ Almost Standards Mode -  Mostly modern, but with a few quirks (very rare)

What Happens in Quirks Mode?
    CSS may behave unexpectedly (div { width: 100px; padding: 20px;} - Total width becomes 140px but in standard mode it should be 100px width, with inside padding)
    Layouts can be inconsistent
    Box model (width/height) may break
    Doesn't use ECMAScript-standard JS

HTML 5 tags/ Semantic elments
    more than 30 new tags came along
    Structural / Semantic Tags (for better layout) - header, footer, nav, section, article, aside, main, figure, figcaption
    Multimedia - audio, video, source, track
    Graphics - canvas (Draw graphics via JavaScript), svg (Scalable Vector Graphics inline drawings)
    Form - datalist, keygen (Generate cryptographic keys - deprecated now), output (Display calculation results)
    Input types - email, date, time, range, number, search, color, tel, url
Other than new tags, localStorage & sessionStorage, <meta name="viewport">, Geolocation API, draggable (<div draggable="true">Drag me!</div>), Service Workers (Offline web app), Web Workers (runs JS in background without freezing main page), websockets etc were introduced in HTML 5

** If div/ any other tag is used instead of main/ article/ section. what happens ?
    code loses Semantic Meaning/ structure/ code readability issue
    loses Accessibility (for screen readers)
    poor SEO

figure || img
    when image needs caption

meter || progress
    static vs dynamic measurement
    battery level, test score vs file upload, loading status

MathML/ complex math formulas
    MathML/ Mathematical Markup Language is XML based used to show math equations in web pages
    üìÑ Used inside HTML5
    üî† Looks like XML: uses tags like <math>, <mrow>, <mi>, <mo>, <msup>, etc.
    üß† Semantic: tells browsers what each part of the math means (not just how it looks)
    üß™ Best supported in Firefox (Chrome needs MathJax for full support)
    üõ†Ô∏è Used in education, scientific publishing, and accessible math

SSE
    Server Sent Events - a way for a server to send automatic updates to web page using HTTP connection
    The server keeps the connection open and pushes updates to the client (browser) whenever there's new data.
    The client doesn't need to keep asking (like in polling).
    It uses a special JavaScript object: EventSource.
    e.g. lie score, news feed, stock price update, chat notification, real time dashboard

SSE || Websocket || Polling (legacy)
    Server to Client, one way || two way || Client keeps asking
    HTTP || custom over TCP || HTTP

Web Worker
    a JavaScript feature that lets you run scripts in the background, without freezing the main webpage.
    * unline ajax, which sends HTTP requests, it only runs background js code
    used for, heavy math/ data processing, image filter, real-time graphs
    they mianly run in external JS files. but to run internally, use a blob 

Manifest File in HTML5
    manifest file/ AppCache manifest was originally used to make web apps work offline by telling the browser which files to cache.
    replaced by Service workers, manifest files are obsolete now
    e.g. <html manifest="app.manifest">...</html>
    in app.manifest > 
        # Files to cache
        index.html
        style.css
        script.js
        images/logo.png

        NETWORK:
        *

Service Worker
    JS file that runs in the background, separate from web pages
    Usage - üß± Caching pages and files + üåê Offline access + üîî Push notifications + ‚è≥ Background sync
    e.g. <script>navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');</script>

Geolocation API
    lets website/ app ask the user's device for physical location, like latitude, logitude
    e.g. <script>
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
            const lat = position.coords.latitude;
            const lon = position.coords.longitude;
            const accuracy = position.coords.accuracy;
            const timestamp = position.coords.timestamp;
        });
    </script>

Web component
    build reusabsle, custom elements in HTML, with their own structure, style & behavior
    types,
        Custom Elements     Make your own HTML tags	                    Clean,reusable components
        Shadow DOM          Keep styles & layout private                Avoids conflicts with other styles
        HTML Templates      Reuse hidden HTML chunks in JavaScript      Dynamic layouts without duplication

Physical tags || Logical/ Semantic tags
    focuses on style || focuses on meaning
    <b>/<i> || <strong>/<em>











=======================================================================
==================*************** CSS ***************==================
=======================================================================

Limitations of CSS
    not a programming language. no conditional logic/ loops
    cant perform calculation other than calc()
    cant modify DOM element
    with CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another

Highest priority CSS/ CSS specificity
    Inline > Internal > External
    CSS specificity determines which style rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element.
        Inline style            1000 (specificity value)
        ID selector             100
        Class selectors (.class), attribute selectors ([type="text"]), pseudo-classes (:hover) - 10
        Type selectors (div, p), pseudo-elements (::before) - 1
        Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~), and negation (:not()) - 0

CSS Custom Properties - Variables
    :root {
        --primary-color: #4f46e5;
    }
    .button {
        background: var(--primary-color);
    }

Layout system - 1D & 2D
    2D
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
            gap: 10px;
        }
    1D
        .container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
            align-items: center;
        }

Pseudo-Elements & Pseudo-Classes
    *** Pseudo-element - Pseudo-elements let you style specific parts of an element's content like before or after content - ::after, ::before, ::first-letter, ::selection, ::placeholder

    *** Pseudo-class - Pseudo-classes define a special state of an element - :hover, :first-child, :focus, :active, :visited, :checked, :nth-child(), :last-of-type, :not(selector)

    h1::after {
        content: '‚ú®';
    }

    a:hover {
        color: red;
    }

Scroll Snap

:has() Selector

Box Model
    box model describes how elements are structured and spaced on webpage. like content, padding, border, margin

px || % || em || rem
    fixed size || based on parent dimension size || Relative to the element's own font size || 

Media Query
    apply different CSS styles based on conditions like - Screen width or height, Device type (screen, print, etc.), Screen resolution, Orientation (landscape or portrait)

Optimize CSS
    minify css, use shorthand properties, avoid deep nesting (.container .card .content .title {...}), Use CSS Variables, reduce repetition.

** Render-Blocking CSS
    when extrenal css is found in a web page, It pauses and waits to finish downloading and reading that file before showing anything on the screen. the BORWSER BLOCKS/ STOPS RENDERING THE PAGE UNTIL CSS IS READY

    How does that hurt performance?
    It causes a blank white screen for longer, especially on slow networks. Users see nothing for a few extra seconds.

Critical CSS?
    Critical CSS is the small part of the full CSS that is needed right away to show the top part of the page (what users see first without scrolling ‚Äî called ‚Äúabove the fold‚Äù). We can inline that small part directly in the HTML <head> so the browser doesn't have to wait.

    Critical CSS: Helps show page faster.
    Render-blocking CSS: Slows down page if not handled properly.

Contain, Will-change, Compositing
    contain property tells browser to treat an element independant from rest of the page
    will-change property tells browser that a certain property of an element will change soon
    Compositing is not a CSS property, but a rendering process inside the browser.
