## FILE & FOLDER STRUCTURE
creating it from scratch
delete app/(tabs) + hooks + constants + components + assets

app/_layout.tsx -
remove - ThemeProvider tag, keep the Stack only & name=index
remove - unwanted imports from top, useColorScheme, colorScheme

app/+not-found.tsx
remove - ThemedText & ThemedView
change - ThemedView to View & ThemedText to Text

app/index.tsx (create a simple index page)
const Home = () => {...}
export default Home;

import {Text} from "react-native";
import {SafeAreaView} from "react-native-safe-area-context";
const Home = () => {
    return (
        <SafeAreaView>
            <Text>Home</Text>
        </SafeAreaView>
    );
};
export default Home;

* Some assets are needed, add them in 'assets' > splash.png, used in app.config & search whole app folder with assets/images & replace all primary assets
* Update app.json > app-name, slug & others as needed
* fonts > download custom fonts > add them in _layout.tsx, like, 
const [loaded] = useFonts({
    "Font-Bold": require("../assets/fonts/Font-Bold.ttf"),
    "Font-ExtraBold": require("../assets/fonts/Font-ExtraBold.ttf"),
})
