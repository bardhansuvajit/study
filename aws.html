AWS with LARAVEL


**Account (Credit/ debit card required)
Create new account/ login > aws.amazon.in > goto Console



**Domain registration + DNS management
Route 53 - DNS servers respond to queries on port 53 and provide answers that route end users to your applications on the Internet.
1 `Register domain` from AWS 
OR
2 Transfer other domain to AWS
2.1 Go to `Hosted zones` > Create
domain name, public hosted zone > SAVE

Records might be created (total 4 records needed as per multiple videos - 2 records have to create and 2 will be created automatically)

2.2 Get IP from EC2 > instances > IPV4 IP (If not set, Set Elastic IP first)

2.3 Create record > Simple routing > Define simple record
OR
Create record > Record type - A - Routes traffic to IPV4 address > use IPV4 IP in value > SAVE

Define another simple record

Add 'www' to Record name > Add 'domain name' in value > Recored type - CNAME > SAVE & CREATE RECORDS

2.4 Use 4 DNS from AWS & update Name-servers them to Domain providers (Like GoDaddy/ others)
DONOT COPY 'last .' From AWS DNS



**ELASTIC IP ADDRESS
to maintain a consistent address via IP even if instance is stopped or restarted
EC2 > Network > Elastic IP
Allocate new IP address > AMazon's pool of IPV4 address > Add a name too > Get the IP address

The IP could be used in domain registration



**SECURITY GROUP
this acts like a virtual firewall that controlls inbound and outbound traffic
EC2 > Network > Security group

Create new > name: public website internet access, desc: open ports 443 & 80 to allow http & https connection to our server >
Add 2 inbound rules > type: http & https, source: anywhere > SAVE

Create new again > name: dev ssh access, desc: allow ssh access for devs
inbound > type: ssh, source: my IP > SAVE

Also name them from the listing page if required



**RDS INSTANCE
seperate database server (expensive)
RDS >
