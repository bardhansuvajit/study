> download & install docker from official website, create account
> to check for docker version, goto CMD/ Terminal, type, `docker version`/ `docker info`, for docker engine information
> `docker images`, to check local images

TRY AN EXAMPLE IMAGE/ CONTAINER
> goto dockerhub, https://hub.docker.com/
> hello world image, `docker pull hello-world`, type in Terminal
> can check for images list
> run it, docker run image-name, `docker run hello-world`
> if you see, hello from docker, it means docker is working fine
> `docker ps`/ `docker ps -a`

START
> Docker is a tool, that does OS level virtualization
OR
> a platform that helps developers to build, share & run applications with container 
> Like, if u need linux based software in windows machine, u need a virtual mahine/ guest OS. with docker we can do it

PROBLEM BEFORE Docker
> After a singledev works in a project, during hand over, all modules might not work properly as some frameworks & library versions might have been updated. Works in my system not others
> After developing for a year, while deploying on server, the app might not run, as server dependencies might not match with developers system

NOW
a Docker container holds everything about a project like codes, runtime, system tools, system libarrues & settings with specific versions. which solves the problem

** IMAGE
are project templates, like a class
> ready to use software, read only template
> images are made with source codes, libraries, external dependencies, supporting tools & docker file
> cannot be updated, if you need to make change in image, create new one
> images can not run directly

** CONTAINER
helps to run examples/ runnable instance of image, like an object
> a process that runs application with help of image
> isolated process, independent to current system software versions
> Like, if system has node 20/ no node, but app needs node 16, it would work properly/ independently

DOCKER HUB
when we need parent images for a project, we get them from hub. like node image is needed for a node based project

DOCKER DESKTOP
system software to manage everything locally

Base Image/ Parent image
main template of a project. like a node/ php based project requires a base image of node js/ php

Pull/ Download Image
goto docker hub/ desktop > serah for image > like, node js, check for official docker image > you can pull/ run or copy the command, docker pull node & run in terminal
