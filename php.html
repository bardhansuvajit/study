OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

** CLASS & OBJECT
Object oriented programming is a concept/ coding style, which has advantages like, less code reusability, DRY method.
Everything is a object (mobile, laptop, bottle)
Class is categorisation of objects based on attribute/ property (variables) & behaviour/ methods (functions). Like, categorising of birds of flying & non-flying bird. 

Class is a template/ blueprint of object and Object is instance (example) of a class
EXAMPLE
class Class1 {
    function fun1() {   // methods
        echo "inside fun1";
    }
}

// now to access the fun1(), we cant directly call/ instantiate it. It would say 'undefined'. To access functions inside a class, we have to create an object of the class.

$object1 = new Class1();
$object1->fun1();       >> OP >> inside fun1


** PUBLIC & THIS
Again, to define properties/ variables

class Class1 {
    // do not write directly $x = 1; it would throw an error. Use 'PUBLIC', access modifier
    // $x = 1;
    public $x = 1;
    function fun1() {   // methods
        echo "inside fun1";
    }

    // to access $x inside fun1(), do not directly go for it (check below). Use 'THIS' keyword instead. else it would throw error
    function fun2() {
        // echo $x;
        echo $this->x;
    }
}


** CONSTRUCTOR & DESTRUCTOR
when object is called, at very first function Construct is called by default. Similarly, when the object's lifecycle is about to end, destructor function is called by default
EXAMPLE
class Class1 {
    function __construct() {
        echo "start";
    }
    function __destruct() {
        echo "end";
    }
}
$obj1 = new Class1();   >> OP >> startend



** INITIALIZE VARIABLE INSIDE CONSTRUCTOR
function __construct() {
    // $x = 10;
    $this->x = 10;
}
function fun1() {
    return $this->x;
}

** TO MAKE THE VARIABLE DYNAMIC
function __construct($y) {
    $this->x = $y;
}
// whenever an object is created for this class, we have to pass the value
$obj1 = new Class1(20);
echo $obj1->fun1();



** INHERITANCE (EXTENDS)
access properties & methods (public & protected) from one class to another class. 
EXAMPLE
class class1 {
    function __construct() {
        echo "construct1";
    }
    function fun1() {
        echo "fun1";
    }
}
class class2 extends class1 {

}

$obj = new class2();    >> OP >> construct1
$obj->fun1();           >> OP >> construct1fun1

NOW, if a constructor is added in class2, child class construct has higher priority. Same thing for functions if they (child & parent class) both have same name
class class2 extends class1 {
    function __construct() {
        echo "construct2";
    }
}
$obj = new class2();    >> OP >> construct2

*NOW, to use both constructors, use
class class2 extends class1 {
    function __construct() {
        parent::__construct(); // in JS, this is like, super(argements)
        echo "construct2";
    }
}
$obj = new class2();    >> OP >> construct1construct2

class class2 extends class1 {
    function __construct() {
        echo "construct2";
        parent::__construct();
    }
}
$obj = new class2();    >> OP >> construct2construct1
:: is scope resolution operator. if parent class has anotherMethod(), we can call it in child class using, parent::anotherMethod()

** ENCAPSULATION, ACCESS MODIFIER, GETTERS, SETTERS
Encapsulation means bundling similar data into a structured unit/ into a capsule format

normally we can update the value outside the class, which is not a good thing. Like the following
EXAMPLE
class Class1 {
    public $var1 = 1;
}
$obj1 = new Class1();
echo $obj1->var1;       >> OP >> 1
$obj1->var1 = 2;
echo $obj1->var1;       >> OP >> 2

Encapsulation comes here. To define/ modify the access level (Access Modifier). Like a property/ method can/ can not be accessed outside class. All access levels are public by default.

// So, making $var1 to protected solves it. 
protected $var1 = 1;

// But we cannot access it outside the class (echo $obj1->var1; // will show error saying, cannot access protected property). NOW we will use, Getters & Setters. So, To access var1 outside the class
// inside the class
public function getVar1() {
    return $this->var1;
}
// outside the class
echo $obj1->getVar1();   >> OP >> 1

Types of Access Modifiers
1. public       >> properties/ methods can be accessed inside/ outside of class scope. This is default
2. protected    >> properties/ methods can be accessed inside of the class scope & its inherited classes
3. private      >> properties/ methods can be accessed ONLY inside of the class scope

* REMEMBER, you cannot directly access 'protected' properties/ methods from inherited/ child class (in Class2, you cannot put directly return $this->var1). You can access it by using Getters & Setters.
EXAMPLE
class Class1 {
	protected $var1 = 22; // if this is made private, it wont work

    public function getVar1() {
    	return $this->var1;
    }

    protected function function1() {
    	return "Hello from class 1";
    }
}

class Class2 extends Class1 {
	public function getVar1FromClass1() {
    	return $this->var1;
    }
}

$obj2 = new Class2();
echo $obj2->getVar1();              >> OP >> 22
echo $obj2->getVar1FromClass1();    >> OP >> 22
echo $obj2->function1();            >> OP >> Error: Call to protected method // cannot directly access a 'protected' method.

REMEMBER, in case of same method name in parent & child class, parent class must have less access than child class. LIKE, if someFunc() is public in parent class & protected in child class, it wont work. Opposite of it would work/ same access would work.
If, both are public someFunc() {...}, called from child class object, it would work and child class will have priority
If, someFunc() is public in parent class, protected in child class, it wont work
If, someFunc() is removed/ made protected in parent class, protected in child class, it works


** ABSTRACTION (Abstract class)
Abstract means partial/ incomplete. Abstract class contains atleast one Abstract/ incomplete function (others maybe regular functions).
1. Why Incomplete ? because, abstract function must be declared but not called/ instantiated
2. Objects can not be created from an Abstract class
3. Inherited/ child class must contain abstract function
4. declared using the `abstract` keyword
5. Any class that extends an abstract class must either implement all of its abstract methods or itself be declared abstract
6. Abstract classes can also contain non-abstract (concrete) methods but must contain at leats one abstract method

// creating 'abstract' class
abstract class Class1 {
    // this would throw error, cannot contain body, as abs. function cannot be called/ implemented
    function test() {
        echo 'test';
    }
}
$obj = new Class1(); // this would throw error, as object cannot be created

// creating abstract function
abstract class Class1 {
    abstract function test();
}

// inheritance/ extending
class Class2 extends Class1 {
    // this will result in error, as child class must contain abstract function. Unless, the same test() is called again here

    function test() {
        echo 'test';
    }
}

FINAL EXAMPLE
abstract class AbstractClass {
    abstract protected function func1($string);
}

class New1 extends AbstractClass {
    public function func1($string) {
        return 'here: '.$string;
    }
}

$classNew = new New1();
echo $classNew->func1('test name');

WHY USE ABSTRACT CLASS
when we need to define a common structure among different classes. 
Suppose, all banks needs idProof(), inside a abstract class bank, we can call abstract function idProof(), now for different classes like, hdfc, sbi extends bank... wont work untill idProof() is used in child class


ENCAPSULATION vs ABSTRACTION
way of protecting data || way of hiding unnecessary information
process of containing information || process of obtaining information
use access specifier || use interface & abstract class


** INTERFACE
(keyword - interface, implements)
PHP doesn't support multiple inheritance. Means, a class cannot inherit/ extend multiple classes
Also, Interface is used to ensure a class has certain methods

class Class3 extends Class1, Class2 {...} // this would throw error

Alternate is Interface. Which,
1. Supports multiple inheritance
2. Interface can only contain abstract methods (no body functions), no regular methods and those function must also be called in 'inherited'/ 'child' class || Abstract classes can have regular methods
3. We cant define 'properties'/ 'variables' || Abstract classes can have
4. No 'Construct' inside interface
5. All methods must be 'public' || Abstract class methods can be 'public'/ 'protected'
6. Interface uses 'implements', Inheritance uses 'extends'
7. Objects cannot be made for interface

* Abstraction vs Interface - the main difference
use INTERFACE, when you want to force people (other developers including you) to implement a set of methods on the classes they are building. It contains only declaration of the methods, no implementation

use ABSTRACTION, when you want to force people to implement a set of methods and some other methods too
It contains method implementations as well as declarations


interface Class1 {...}
interface Class2 {...}
class Class3 implements Class1, Class2 {...}

NOW,
interface class1 {
    // will throw err, as its not an abstract function
    public function function1() {
        ...
    }

    // calling abstract function, which has no body, which must also be called in child class
    public function function2();
}
class class3 implements class1 {
    public function function2() {
        return "here in func1";
    }
}

$obj1 = new class1(); // this would throw, as interface class canot have object
$obj3 = new class3();
$obj3->function2();     >> OP >> here in func1


** STATIC MEMBERS
To access properties/ methods without creating onject of a class

1. To access static properties/ methods, do not create 'object'. Call it's class
2. Concept of 'this' keyword does not work here, as 'this' represents current object and there is no concept of object creation. use 'self' instead
3. 'constructor' wont be called here, as there is no concept of creating 'object'

class class1 {
    public static $num = 10;
    public $num2 = 20;

    public static function func1() {
        echo "inside function1";
    }

    public static function func2() {
        echo self::num; // only to access static property
        echo self::num2; // would throw
        echo $this->num2;
    }
}
$obj = new class1();
echo $obj->num; // cannot be accessed as it's a 'static' variable

// to access static variable, call its class
echo class1::$num;          >> OP >> 10
echo class1::func1();       >> OP >> inside function1


** TRAIT (keyword - trait, use)
Problem with 'Inheritance' is when extended to multiple classes, the inherited/ child class has access to all the properties/ methods of parent class and classes before them. 'Trait' solves this.
EXAMPLE
class class1{...}
class class2 extends class1{...}
class class3 extends class2{...}
class class4 extends class3{...} // class 4 can access the properties/ methods of class1, class2 & class3. But it does not need the properties/ methods of class1 and class2. 'Trait' solves this.

trait class1{...}       // initializing 'trait', exactly like 'class' keyword, just replace it
class class2 {
    use class1;         // using 'trait'
    ...
}
// whenever trait is needed go with, 'use trait1, trait2'
// if sameNameFunction() is used in both trait & class, function inside class has more preference. Instantiating the function will result content in class
// if both traits have sameNameFunction(), instantiating the function will throw. to fix it,
trait t1 {
    function func1() {...}
}
trait t2 {
    function func1() {...}
}
class class1 {
    use t1, t2 {
        t1::func1 insteadof t2; // when you need only 'func1' from t1
        t2::func1 as func2; // if you need 'func1' from t2 too. Use alias 'as' like 'sql'
    }
}
$obj = new class1();
$obj->func1(); // this would work


** POLYMORPHISM
same operation may behave differently in different class. 
2 process - Through Abstract class & Interface
2 types - Compile time (Method overloading) & Run time (Method overriding)

EXAMPLE through Abstract Class
abstract class Class1 {
	abstract function absFunc1();
}

class Class2 extends Class1 {
	public function absFunc1() {
    	echo "fun 2";
    }
}
class Class3 extends Class1 {
	public function absFunc1() {
    	echo "fun 3";
    }
}

$obj1 = new Class2();
$obj1->absFunc1();      >> OP >> fun 2
$obj2 = new Class3();
$obj2->absFunc1();      >> OP >> fun 3

// NOW, both Class2 & Class3 has same function, absFunc1(), but they retuns/ behaves differently in different classes. This is 'Polymorphism'

EXAMPLE through Interface
interface Class1 {
	function absFunc1();
}

class Class2 implements Class1 {
	public function absFunc1() {
    	echo "fun 2";
    }
}
class Class3 implements Class1 {
	public function absFunc1() {
    	echo "fun 3";
    }
}

$obj1 = new Class2();
$obj1->absFunc1();      >> OP >> fun 2
$obj2 = new Class3();
$obj2->absFunc1();      >> OP >> fun 3

METHOD/ FUNCTION OVERLOADING
When same function name is defined twice/ multiple times using different parameters. (Not supported by PHP traditionally, but can be achieved a form of overloading by using __call() magic method)
class Test {
    function plus($num1, $num2) {...}
    function plus($num1, $num2, $num3) {...}
}
METHOD/ FUNCTION OVERRIDING
When you extend a class & rewrite a same function that already exists in parent class


** NAMESPACE
prevent conflict among classes with same name

1. when we have multiple SameNameClass and we need to include them in a same php file
2. instantiate 'namespace namespaceName' at very top of file
3. to create instance/ object, $obj = new namespaceName\SameNameClass


** MAGIC METHOD
Called automatically, when something happens with your objects (like creating, accessing a property/ method). 
> They allow you to customize how the object behaves
> start with double underscores

COMMON METHODS
__construct, automatically called when a new object is created
__destruct, called when an object is destroyed
__call(), handles calling to undefined/ inaccessible methods
__callStatic(), handles calling to undefined/ inaccessible STATIC methods (same as __call())
__get(), __set(), 

EXAMPLE
class Example {
    public function __call($name, $arguments) {
        echo "Called method $name with arguments: " . implode(', ', $arguments);
    }
}

$obj = new Example();
$obj->someMethod('arg1', 'arg2'); // Outputs: Called method someMethod with arguments: arg1, arg2



REQUIRE vs INCLUDE
when error occurs, generates fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) || generates warning (E_WARNING)
will stop execution of script || wont stop


FINAL
the final keyword is used to prevent a class/ method from being extended or overridden. 
> It's a way of saying, "This is the final version—don't change it."

EXAMPLE
final class BaseClass {
    public function func() {
        echo "Hello from BaseClass!";
    }
}

// This will cause an error because BaseClass cannot be extended.
class ChildClass extends BaseClass {
    ...
}



** NEW in PHP 7 than 5
1.  Faster execution & reduced memory usage
2.  Scalar type declarations
    > Specify type for function arguments
    > function someFunc(int $num1) {...}
3.  Return type declarations
    > define expected return type to function
    > // function Func(int $num1) : int {...}
4.  Null Coalescing operator (??)
    > $username = $_GET['user'] ?? 'guest';
5.  Spaceship operator (<=>)
    > returns -1,0,1 when two variables are less than, equal to, greater than
    > echo 2 <=> 3; // Outputs: -1
6.  Anonymous class
    > $obj = new class {
        public function sayHello() {
            return "Hello!";
        }
    };
    echo $obj->sayHello();
7.  Constant arrays using define()
    > define('ANIMALS', ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']);
8.  unicode excape // echo "\u{1F602}"; // outputs 😂

https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php


** NEW in PHP 8 than 7
1.  JIT compiler(Just in time compiler)
    > to improve performance, to compile PHP code to machine code. can be manually enabled/ disabled
2. Union types
    > allow methods to accept multiple types. 
    > function foo(int|string $value) {
        return $value;
    }



Constructor property promotion // Less code to define & initialize properties


Named arguments // this allows passing arguments to methods by writing parameter names, rather than relying on the order of params, 
function greet($name, $age) {
    echo "Hello $name, you are $age years old!";
}
greet(age: 30, name: 'John');

match expression // alternative to switch statement
$result = match ($value) {
    1 => 'One',
    2 => 'Two',
    default => 'Other',
};

Nullsafe operator // ?-> // allows to handle nullable values without needing multiple null checks
$value = $obj?->getProperty()?->getValue();
