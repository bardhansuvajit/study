php - personal home page
Acronym is PHP: hypertext preprocessor

> PHP is a scripting language
> PHP needs minimum a local environment to run. mostly runs on web server

> Web server processes incoming HTTP requests using different protocols
client/ user >> HTTP request >> server hardware >> web server software (apache/ nginix) >> finds file, processes PHP codes/ Outputs >> responses back to user

> XAMPP/ MAMP/ WAMP/ Laragon - bundles PHP/ web servers/ databases/ others and handles the configuration
** DOCKER is better as XAMPP doesn't support multiple PHP versions, multiple mysql versions, not good for production, difficult to maintain multiple projects, problems like scripts run on local but not on production

> syntax <?php codes ?> OR <?= CODES ?>    
> missing ; throws parse error
> <?php echo 'LOREM IPSUM'; ?>
