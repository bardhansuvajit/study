1.  Duplicate records
>   select column, count(*) as total_count from table
    group by column
    having total_count > 1

2.  ** 3rd highest salary
>   select salary from table
    order by salary desc
    limit 1 offset 2/ limit 2,1

(offset means skip first 2 rows, limit is used to limit the rows count to 1)

BUT, in this case, 100, 90, 90, 80, 70 - 80 being third highest but the above query would return 90 after sorting the table in desc salary order. so correct query would be,

>   select distinct salary from table
    order by salary desc
    limit 2,1
