React
    is a Javascript library (A JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written JS code that provides ready-to-use functions so developers don't have to write everything from scratch.) to build dynamic & interactive web pages
    Developer by Facebook in 2011
    Angular is a JS Framework (a framework gives full structure to run codes. it decides when the code runs. we work inside its rules.)

***** WHY REACT
    React is fast because it maintains a virtual DOM and updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM. It also uses component-based architecture, making code reusable and scalable.

*****
DOM (Document Object Model)
    when web page is loaded, HTML is parsed/ read as objects and nodes (Tree-like structure) by the browser, so that JS can access & manipulate it. 
    This tree like structure is called DOM.
SHADOW DOM
    a separate hidden DOM. used in reusable component. 
    To keep the internal structure (HTML, CSS & JS) private and separate from the rest of the page. Code inside shadow DOM component cannot be accessed/ affected by the code outside
    Used for encapsulation (separate capsule format) in Web Components. Web components consist of - Custom elements + Shadow DOM + HTML templates
BOM (Browser Object Model)
    set of objects by browser to interact with browser window, not just web page
    OBJECTS
        window, navigator, location, history, screen, alert, confirm, prompt
    EXAMPLE
        console.log(window.innerWidth);    // width of browser window
        console.log(navigator.userAgent);  // browser info
        location.href = "https://example.com"; // redirect
vDOM (Virtual DOM)
    A lightweight copy of real DOM used for performance (used by React)
    It helps update only the parts that changed, instead of re-rendering the whole page — making the UI faster and more efficient.


JS vs React JS
    Manually update DOM (slow & repetitive) || uses vDOM → updates only what changed (faster)

Component
    are reusable codes. App component is the root

Node JS for React
    Node creates a local development server and provides npm to use packages/libraries — that's why we need it for React projects.
    React runs in the browser. Node is needed only to develop, build, and manage React apps.


VITE
    Fast dev server + asset bundling tool
    What Vite does
        Starts a lightning-fast local server with hot reload
        Converts JSX / TypeScript / SCSS etc. to browser-ready JS & CSS
        Splits and compresses code for fast loading
        Merges and minifies final JS/CSS for deployment
    *****
    WHY
        A browser cannot read JSX, imports, modules or unprocessed React code directly. SO we need a server that can convert JSX to Javascript, combine & serve module, reload page instantly when code changes
    WHY Vite create a server
        Watches code for changes (so no need to refresh manually), Converts JSX / TypeScript / SCSS on the fly


CREATE REACT APP
npm create vite@latest (project name > react-app-1, cd react-app-1)
*****
npm install
    "npm install" reads the dependency list from "package.json" and installs all required packages into the "node_modules" directory. It ensures the project has the exact versions of libraries needed to run and build the application.

    when a new react/ laravel project is created, this file is created, "package.json", which has a list of required tools/ packages but not downloaded yet
    when "npm install" runs, NPM looks at "package.json" and downloads everything into "node_modules" folder
    Without "npm install", the project cannot run because the necessary tools are missing.
    package-lock.json is created/ updated when "npm install" is run. package-lock.json records what exactly was installed with exact version
*****
npm run dev
    starts the local development server/ start React in development mode
    launches Vite, compiles React code, opens the app in the browser (e.g., http://localhost:5173), refreshes the UI automatically when you make changes (Hot Reload)


FOLDERS
    node_modules > libraries & dependencies
    public > public/ static assets
    src > main react code
        components > reusable parts
        assets > images, fonts, other static files
        styles > css
    package.json > project info, name, version, dependencies
    tsconfig.json > tell typescript compiler how to compile our code to JS
    vite.config.js > vite configs


***** FILE EXTENSION
    React files are save in .JSX (Javascript XML) - write HTML tags inside JavaScript.
    JSX is not native JavaScript. Browser does NOT understand JSX. Babel compiles JSX to normal JavaScript before the browser runs it.
    .ts || .tsx > simple typescript file || react components

COMPONENT
    Functional component
    Class component (older, not used now)

    create new file Message.tsx (use PascalCasing here)
        function Message() {
            return <h1>Lorem ipsum</h1>;
            OR
            const name = 'Test';
            return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>        // inside {}, braces we can write any js expression
            OR
            const name = 'Some name';
            if (name)
                return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
            return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
        }
        export default Message;
    ***** JSX -> <h1>Lorem ipsum</h1> -> this part is JSX

    Now, in App.tsx, remove all & import Message
    import Message from './Message';

    function App() {
        return <div><Message></Message></div> // always close React component
        OR
        return <div><Message /></div>
    }
    export default App;

    create new component > export > import it too

HOW REACT WORKS
    When React application starts, based on components, React creates a component tree/ JS Data Structure called "Virtual DOM". 
    Different from the actual DOM its lightweight and in memeory representation of our component tree where each node represents each component & its properties.
    When the state/ data of a component changes, React updates the node in vDOM to reflect new state
    Then it compares the current version with previous version of vDOM to identify the nodes that should be updated. It will then update those nodes in the actual DOM
    Technically React doesnt update the DOM itself, its done by companion library called React-DOM

REACT || REACT-DOM
    in package.json there are these 2 dependencies
    react-dom helps React interact with the browser DOM.
