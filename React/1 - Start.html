React
    is a Javascript library (A JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written JS code that provides ready-to-use functions so developers don't have to write everything from scratch.)
    Developer by Facebook in 2011

DOM (Document Object Model)
    HTML is parsed/ read as objects and nodes (Tree-like structure) by the browser, so that JS can access & manipulate it. 
    This tree like structure is called DOM.
SHADOW DOM
    a separate hidden DOM. used in reusable component. 
    To keep the internal structure (HTML, CSS & JS) private and separate from the rest of the page. Code inside shadow DOM component cannot be accessed/ affected by the code outside
    Used for encapsulation (separate capsule format) in Web Components. Web components consist of - Custom elements + Shadow DOM + HTML templates
BOM (Browser Object Model)
    set of objects by browser to interact with browser window, not just web page
    OBJECTS
        window, navigator, location, history, screen, alert, confirm, prompt
    EXAMPLE
        console.log(window.innerWidth);    // width of browser window
        console.log(navigator.userAgent);  // browser info
        location.href = "https://example.com"; // redirect
vDOM (Virtual DOM)
    A lightweight copy of real DOM used for performance (used by React)
    It helps update only the parts that changed, instead of re-rendering the whole page — making the UI faster and more efficient.


JS vs React JS
    Manually update DOM (slow & repetitive) || uses vDOM → updates only what changed (faster)

Component
    are reusable codes. App component is the root

Node JS for React
    Node creates a local development server and provides npm to use packages/libraries — that's why we need it for React projects.
    React runs in the browser. Node is needed only to develop, build, and manage React apps.


VITE
    Fast dev server + asset bundling tool
    What Vite does
        Starts a lightning-fast local server with hot reload
        Converts JSX / TypeScript / SCSS etc. to browser-ready JS & CSS
        Splits and compresses code for fast loading
        Merges and minifies final JS/CSS for deployment
