UNDERSTAND PERMISSIONS
===========================================================================

Hold 10 characters, every permission string look like ---------- this

Divided into 4 parts
    File Type - (normally is -/d)
        dash (-) represents any Regular file, like text file, code file,
        d represents Directory,
        c represents Character device file, b means Block device file, s Local socket file, p Named pipe, I Symbolic link
    Owner Permission --- (normally is rwx)
        3 characters only 
    Group Permission --- (normally is rwx)
        3 characters only
    Other Users Permission --- (normally is rwx)
        3 characters only

** Hence, there are 3 permissions to give, to Owners, Groups and other users
** And 3 types of permissions
    - No permission for files. Directory content cannot be shown
    r Read permission for files. Directory content can be shown
    w Write permission for files. Directory content can be altered
    x execute permission for files. Directory can be navigated using 'cd'



===========================================================================
** EXAMPLE
===========================================================================

-rwxr-xr--
    10 characters here
    1. -    means its a FILE. not directory. it would be 'd' if it was directory
    2. rwx  means OWNER user can read write & execute
    3. r-x  means any GROUP user can read & execute. not write
    4. r--  meansall other users can only read



===========================================================================

===========================================================================

chmod needs scope, action & permissions
> chmod u=rwx file/ folder_name
Scope
    u means user - owner of the file
    g means users of the group
    o means other users, not owner/ not in group
