=================*************** HTML ***************==================
=======================================================================

HTML
    - Hypertext (Text with reference/ text that can be accessed) Markup (used TAGS to mark language) Language

IDE
    - integrated (together) development environment, like VS code, sublime text
    - increases productivity, code auutocomplete, syntax highlight, error check

API
    Application Programming Interface - used to communicate with different systems
    REST API - Representational State Transfer - Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) - uses JSON data format
    SOAP API - Simple Object Access Protocol - XML-based, very strict and formal - Often used in banking/ enterprise/ legacy systems - Old web services or government APIs
    GraphQL API - created by Facebook - Client can request exact data needed - Efficient &  flexible, especially in modern apps
    gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) - very fast, uses binary format (Protocol Buffers) - Ideal for microservices

HTML || XML || XHTML
    HTML for most websites.
    XML when storing or sharing data. (eXtensible Markup Language)
        some old/ enterprise systems still send data in XML, like SOAP APIs
        Many apps/tools use XML for configuration (e.g., Android AndroidManifest.xml, VS Code settings).
        JSON replaced XML
    XHTML only if required to follow strict standards. (eXtensible HTML)
        Some older sites still use XHTML 1.0 Strict or Transitional.
        HTML5 replaced XHML

HTML list
    - orderred, unordered & definition (dl/dt/dd - Definition List/ Definition Term/ Definition Description)

Meta tag
    provides additional info about website - like, author, desc, keyword

HTML || HTML 5
    needed Flash/ plugins to work with audio/ video file || built in audio & video tags
    used div always || uses semantic tags <header> <main> <footer> for better understanding
    only input type text & password supported || new types, date email range etc

!DOCTYPE
    "DOCTYPE" = Document Type. 
    When declared, it means, this document is type - HTML5. Browser will render it using modern rules
    Helps the browser avoid quirks mode. Uses Standard mode

** Quirks Mode || Standards mode || Almost Standards Mode (Browser modes)
    ‚úÖ Standards Mode -             Follows modern HTML/CSS rules (triggered by <!DOCTYPE html>)
    üü° Quirks Mode -                Uses old, forgiving rules (if DOCTYPE is missing or wrong)
    üîµ Almost Standards Mode -      Mostly modern, but with a few quirks (very rare)

What Happens in Quirks Mode?
    CSS may behave unexpectedly (div { width: 100px; padding: 20px;} - Total width becomes 140px but in standard mode it should be 100px width, with inside padding)
    Layouts can be inconsistent
    Box model (width/height) may break
    Doesn't use ECMAScript-standard JS

HTML 5 tags/ Semantic elments
    more than 30 new tags came along
    Structural / Semantic Tags (for better layout) - header, footer, nav, section, article, aside, main, figure, figcaption
    Multimedia - audio, video, source, track
    Graphics - canvas (Draw graphics via JavaScript), svg (Scalable Vector Graphics inline drawings)
    Form - datalist, keygen (Generate cryptographic keys - deprecated now), output (Display calculation results)
    Input types - email, date, time, range, number, search, color, tel, url
Other than new tags, localStorage & sessionStorage, <meta name="viewport">, Geolocation API, draggable (<div draggable="true">Drag me!</div>), Service Workers (Offline web app), Web Workers (runs JS in background without freezing main page), websockets etc were introduced in HTML 5

** If div/ any other tag is used instead of main/ article/ section. what happens ?
    code loses Semantic Meaning/ structure/ code readability issue
    loses Accessibility (for screen readers)
    poor SEO

figure || img
    when image needs caption

meter || progress
    static vs dynamic measurement
    battery level, test score vs file upload, loading status

MathML/ complex math formulas
    MathML/ Mathematical Markup Language is XML based used to show math equations in web pages
    üìÑ Used inside HTML5
    üî† Looks like XML: uses tags like <math>, <mrow>, <mi>, <mo>, <msup>, etc.
    üß† Semantic: tells browsers what each part of the math means (not just how it looks)
    üß™ Best supported in Firefox (Chrome needs MathJax for full support)
    üõ†Ô∏è Used in education, scientific publishing, and accessible math

SSE
    Server Sent Events - a way for a server to send automatic updates to web page using HTTP connection
    The server keeps the connection open and pushes updates to the client (browser) whenever there's new data.
    The client doesn't need to keep asking (like in polling).
    It uses a special JavaScript object: EventSource.
    e.g. lie score, news feed, stock price update, chat notification, real time dashboard

SSE || Websocket || Polling (legacy)
    Server to Client, one way || two way || Client keeps asking
    HTTP || custom over TCP || HTTP

Web Worker
    a JavaScript feature that lets you run scripts in the background, without freezing the main webpage.
    * unline ajax, which sends HTTP requests, it only runs background js code
    used for, heavy math/ data processing, image filter, real-time graphs
    they mianly run in external JS files. but to run internally, use a blob 

Manifest File in HTML5
    manifest file/ AppCache manifest was originally used to make web apps work offline by telling the browser which files to cache.
    replaced by Service workers, manifest files are obsolete now
    e.g. <html manifest="app.manifest">...</html>
    in app.manifest > 
        # Files to cache
        index.html
        style.css
        script.js
        images/logo.png

        NETWORK:
        *

Service Worker
    JS file that runs in the background, separate from web pages
    Usage - üß± Caching pages and files + üåê Offline access + üîî Push notifications + ‚è≥ Background sync
    e.g. <script>navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');</script>

Geolocation API
    lets website/ app ask the user's device for physical location, like latitude, logitude
    e.g. <script>
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
            const lat = position.coords.latitude;
            const lon = position.coords.longitude;
            const accuracy = position.coords.accuracy;
            const timestamp = position.coords.timestamp;
        });
    </script>

Web component
    build reusabsle, custom elements in HTML, with their own structure, style & behavior
    types,
        Custom Elements     Make your own HTML tags	                    Clean,reusable components
        Shadow DOM          Keep styles & layout private                Avoids conflicts with other styles
        HTML Templates      Reuse hidden HTML chunks in JavaScript      Dynamic layouts without duplication

Physical tags || Logical/ Semantic tags
    focuses on style || focuses on meaning
    <b>/<i> || <strong>/<em>

What are semantic HTML elements?
    Semantic HTML elements are HTML tags that clearly describe their meaning and purpose in both human and machine-readable ways. Like, hedaer, footer, nav etc.
     Benefits:
        Accessibility: Screen readers can interpret content more accurately.
        better SEO
        Maintainability: Code is easier to read and maintain.
        Standardization

<div> || <span>
    Both are non-semantic eleemnts. But
    Block || inline level

HTML4 || HTML5
    released in 1997 || 2014
    No semantic elements || header, footer, nav, article, section
    requires plugin like Flash for Multimedia Support || Native support for <audio>, <video>, <canvas>
    No built-in APIs || Supports APIs like Web Storage, Geolocation, Drag & Drop, WebSockets, etc.
    Basic text input text, password || more types like email, date, range, tel etc.
    Deprecated tags like <font>, <center>
    Graphics Support needs plugins ||<canvas> and <svg> supported natively

data- attributes
    custom attributes that allow you to store extra information on HTML elements

local storage || session storage
    Feature	            Local Storage	                                            Session Storage
    üïì Lifetime	        Until manually cleared by user/ JS	                        Until the browser tab/ window closes
    üì¶ Storage Size	    ~5-10 MB per origin	                                        ~5 MB per tab
    üåç Scope	        Shared across all tabs/windows                              Unique to each tab/window
    üîÅ Persistence	    Data persists even after reloads or browser restarts	    Data clears on tab close
    üîí Security	        Same-origin policy applies	                                Same-origin policy applies
    üîÉ Auto-expiry?	    ‚ùå No automatic expiration	                              ‚úÖ Expires with tab/window
    üìñ Accessibility	Across tabs/windows (same origin)	                        Only in current tab/window

How would you embed audio and video in HTML5?
    <audio controls autoplay loop muted preload>
        <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="song.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    <video width="640" height="360" controls poster="thumbnail.jpg">
        <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

Accessibility in HTML
    Accessibility in HTML means designing the web content so that everyone, including people with disabilities can perceive, navigate, and interact with it effectively.
    HOW
        using semantic tags
        alt tags for images
        labels for form inputs
        Keyboard Navigability (onclick, onkeydown, onkeypress)
        use ARIA for modals, sliders (role="button", role="dialog", aria-expanded, aria-label)
        Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background
        Use captions, transcripts, and <track> tags for audio/video (<track src="subtitles.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">)
        Avoid Auto-Playing Content
        Avoid generic links like "Click here". Instead: <a href="/pricing">View pricing plans</a>

What Are Screen Readers?
    Software tools used by visually impaired or blind users to read aloud the content of a webpage. 
    They interpret HTML, text, and structure ‚Äî and convert it into speech or Braille output.

What are ARIA roles and why are they used?
    ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles are used to improve accessibility by providing extra information to assistive technologies (like screen readers) ‚Äî especially when semantic HTML alone is not enough.

How does browser work when an script tag is found without/ with defer or async
    When the browser loads an HTML page, it parses (reads) the HTML from top to bottom, building the page structure called DOM
    If it encounters a script without defer or async, like <script src="script.js"></script>
    the browser will:
        Stop parsing > Download the script > Run the script > then continue parsing rest of the page
    This "pause" is called parsing blocked.
    It can delay the page from rendering, especially if the script takes time to load or execute.

defer and async attributes on script tag
    With defer or async:
    HTML parsing continues while the script is downloading ‚Äî ‚úÖ non-blocking
    So, the page can load faster 
    
    MAIN Difference
    async Executes as soon as it's downloaded (possibly before HTML finishes parsing)	
    defer Executes after HTML parsing is complete

    OTHER Differences
    | Feature                            | No Attribute               | `defer`            | `async`               |
    | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
    | Download time                      | Asynchronous               | Asynchronous       | Asynchronous          |
    | Parsing (HTML page read) blocked   | Yes                        | No                 | No                    |
    | ***Execution time                  | Immediately after download | After HTML parsing | As soon as downloaded |
    | Execution order (multiple scripts) | In order                   | In order           | Not guaranteed        |
    | DOM Ready Dependency               | Shouldn't depend           | Safe               | Not safe              |


What is the shadow DOM and how does it work with web components?
    A built-in browser feature that lets you encapsulate (unaffected) a part of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it's isolated from the rest of the page, by creating custom HTML elements ‚Äî like your own <my-button> or <user-card>.
    You use Shadow DOM by attaching it to a custom HTML element using JavaScript.

    Web components consist of - Custom elements + SHadow DOM + HTML templates















=======================================================================
==================*************** CSS ***************==================
=======================================================================

Cascade
    The cascade is the process by which the browser decides which CSS rule to apply when multiple rules match the same element.

Limitations of CSS
    not a programming language. no conditional logic/ loops
    cant perform calculation other than calc()
    cant modify DOM element
    with CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another

Highest priority CSS/ CSS specificity
    Inline > Internal > External
    CSS specificity determines which style rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element.
        !important              Overrides specificity
        Inline style            1000 (specificity value)
        #ID                     100
        Class selectors (.class), attribute selectors ([type="text"]), pseudo-classes (:hover) - 10
        Type selectors (div, p), pseudo-elements (::before) - 1
        Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~), and negation (:not()) - 0

CSS Custom Properties - Variables
    :root {
        --primary-color: #4f46e5;
    }
    .button {
        background: var(--primary-color);
    }

Layout system - 1D & 2D
    2D
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
            gap: 10px;
        }
    1D
        .container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
            align-items: center;
        }

Pseudo-Elements & Pseudo-Classes
    Pseudo-elements let you style specific parts of an element's content like before or after content - ::after, ::before, ::first-letter, ::selection, ::placeholder

    Pseudo-classes define a special state of an element - :hover, :first-child, :focus, :active, :visited, :checked, :nth-child(), :last-of-type, :not(selector)

    h1::after {
        content: '‚ú®';
    }

    a:hover {
        color: red;
    }

Scroll Snap
    CSS feature for creating smooth, precise scrolling experiences (especially useful for carousels, sliders, and full-page scroll layouts).
    ‚úÖ Make elements "stick" to specific positions when scrolling (horizontally or vertically).

:has() Selector
    lets you style an element based on what it contains.
    div:has(img) {
        border: 2px solid green;
    }

Box Model
    box model describes how elements are structured and spaced on webpage. like content, padding, border, margin

px || % || em || rem
    fixed size || based on parent dimension size || Relative to the element's own font size || 

Media Query
    apply different CSS styles based on conditions like - Screen width or height, Device type (screen, print, etc.), Screen resolution, Orientation (landscape or portrait)

Optimize CSS
    minify css, use shorthand properties, avoid deep nesting (.container .card .content .title {...}), Use CSS Variables, reduce repetition.

** Render-Blocking CSS
    when extrenal css is found in a web page, It pauses and waits to finish downloading and reading that file before showing anything on the screen. the BORWSER BLOCKS/ STOPS RENDERING THE PAGE UNTIL CSS IS READY

    How does that hurt performance?
    It causes a blank white screen for longer, especially on slow networks. Users see nothing for a few extra seconds.

Critical CSS?
    Critical CSS is the small part of the full CSS that is needed right away to show the top part of the page (what users see first without scrolling ‚Äî called ‚Äúabove the fold‚Äù). We can inline that small part directly in the HTML <head> so the browser doesn't have to wait.

    Critical CSS: Helps show page faster.
    Render-blocking CSS: Slows down page if not handled properly.

Contain, Will-change, Compositing
    contain property tells browser to treat an element independant from rest of the page
    will-change property tells browser that a certain property of an element will change soon
    Compositing is not a CSS property, but a rendering process inside the browser. 

Flexbox || Grid - 2 powerful CSS Layout
    | Feature                  | Flexbox                           | Grid                                |

    | **Control over layout**  | Limited                           | High precision                      |
    | **Responsive design**    | Easy stacking                     | Great for defining responsive zones |
    | **Overlapping elements** | Difficult                         | Easy with `grid-area`               |

How does the cascade work in CSS?
    The cascade is the process by which the browser decides which CSS rule to apply when multiple rules match the same element.
    Follow Specificity

center a div vertically and horizontally using Flexbox
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="centered-box">I'm centered!</div>
    </div>

    <style>
        .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center; /* horizontal centering */
            align-items: center;     /* vertical centering */
            height: 100vh;           /* full viewport height */
            background: #f0f0f0;
        }
        .centered-box {
            width: 20px;
            height: 20px;

pure CSS tooltip
    <div class="tooltip">
        Hover me
        <span class="tooltip-text">This is a tooltip</span>
    </div>

    <style>
        .tooltip {
            position: relative;
            display: inline-block;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
        .tooltip-text {
            visibility: hidden;
            width: 140px;
            background-color: black;
            color: #fff;
            text-align: center;

            left: 50%;
            transform: translateX(-50%);
            
            opacity: 0;
            transition: opacity 0.3s;
            z-index: 10;

            visibility: visible;
            opacity: 1;
        }

How do you handle browser compatibility issues in CSS?
    use @supports
        @supports (display: grid) {
            .layout {display: grid;}
        }
        @supports not (display: grid) {
            .layout {display: flex;}
        }
    use fallback
        .button {
            background: linear-gradient(to right, #f06, #4a90e2); /* modern */
            background: #f06; /* fallback for older browsers */
        }
    Use Autoprefixers
        -webkit-transform/ -moz-transition/ -ms-grid

What is the purpose of CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS?
    to manage CSS easier, faster, and more maintainable, especially in large projects. Features like,
        1. Write reusable values for colors, fonts, spacing, etc. $primary-color: #4caf50; .button {background-color: $primary-color;}
        2. Organize CSS more like HTML structure. 
        div {
            ul {
                a {
                    color :white;
                }
            }
        }
        3. Mixins - Reusable blocks of styles, like functions. 
        @mixin button-style {
            padding: 10px 20px;
            border-radius: 5px;
        }
        .button {
            @include button-style;
        }
        4. Inheritance (@extend)
        5. Math and Functions

Have you used tools like PostCSS, Autoprefixer, or PurgeCSS?
    these tools are used to make CSS more powerful, cleaner, and compatible across browsers.
    1. PostCSS - The CSS Transformer Engine
        processes & modify CSS before it's sent to the browser
    2. Autoprefixer - Browser Compatibility Helper
        adds correct vendor prefixes to CSS automatically (like -webkit-, -ms-, etc.).
    3. PurgeCSS - Remove Unused CSS
        scans HTML, JS, and templates to find out which CSS classes you actually use, and removes everything else.

    üì± Mobile-First Design
    You start designing for the smallest screen (mobile), then progressively enhance for larger devices like tablets and desktops.
        /* Mobile styles (default) */
        body {
            font-size: 14px;
        }
        /* Larger screens ‚Äî enhance */
        @media (min-width: 768px) {
            body {
                font-size: 16px;
            }
        }

    üíª Desktop-First Design
    You start with large screen styles, then use media queries to scale down for smaller devices.
        /* Desktop styles (default) */
        body {
            font-size: 18px;
        }
        /* Smaller screens ‚Äî override */
        @media (max-width: 768px) {
            body {
                font-size: 14px;
            }
        }

    Use **Mobile-First** when:
    | ------------------------------------------- |
    ‚úÖ Building modern, responsive web apps
    ‚úÖ Prioritizing mobile users (e.g., eCommerce, news)
    ‚úÖ You want better performance & accessibility

    Use **Desktop-First** when:             
    | ------------------------------------------- |
    ‚úÖ You're updating an old desktop-only app
    ‚úÖ Mobile traffic is negligible
    ‚úÖ You need rich, complex desktop interfaces


How to properly manage CSS in large-scale applications?
    1. Use a Scalable CSS Architecture
        BEM (Block Element Modifier)
            Naming convention for clarity and reusability
            <div class="card card--highlight">
                <h2 class="card__title">Title</h2>
                <p class="card__description">Details</p>
            </div>

        OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS)
            Separate structure from look, like object-oriented programming does with behavior and data.
            <div class="media box bg-light">
                <img src="..." class="media__img">
                <div class="media__body">Text</div>
            </div>

        SMACSS (Scalable and Modular)
            Classify styles by role (base, layout, etc.)
            /* base/_typography.scss */
            body { font-family: sans-serif; }

            /* layout/_grid.scss */
            .l-grid { display: grid; }

            /* module/_button.scss */
            .btn { padding: 10px; }

            /* state/_visibility.scss */
            .is-hidden { display: none; }

        Atomic CSS / Utility-First (e.g., Tailwind)
            Small utility classes (no custom CSS per component)
            <button class="px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
                Click Me
            </button>


    2. Organize CSS Codebase (modular folder structure)
        /styles
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base/         ‚Üê Reset, typography
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/   ‚Üê Buttons, cards, inputs
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/       ‚Üê Grids, header, footer
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/        ‚Üê Page-specific styles
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/        ‚Üê Mixins, variables, helpers
            main.scss

    3. Use Preprocessors or PostCSS
    4. Follow Naming Conventions
        Use BEM, camelCase, or kebab-case ‚Äî but stick to one.
        Avoid generic class names like .box, .style1, .foo.
    5. Lint and Validate Your CSS
        stylelint - Enforces consistent CSS style rules
        Prettier - Formats CSS uniformly
    6. Optimize CSS for Performance
        PurgeCSS: Remove unused styles
        Minify with cssnano
    7. Treat styles as components
        each UI element should have its own self-contained style.
    8. Use a Design System or Component Library
        Helps maintain consistent look & feel across the app.
        Create reusable UI components (buttons, forms, cards)
    9. Documentation & Team Standards
        Write a style guide for how to name, structure, and write CSS
        Use code reviews to enforce consistency
