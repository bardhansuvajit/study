üîß Performance & Optimization

1. How does indexing work in MySQL? What are the types of indexes?
    Explain B-Tree, Hash, Full-text, and Spatial indexes.
    Know differences between primary, unique, composite, covering indexes.

2. What is a covering index?
    A covering index is one that contains all the columns needed by a query.
    So the query can be satisfied entirely by the index, without touching the table (no "back to table" lookup).

3. How does the MySQL query optimizer work?
    The optimizer decides the most efficient way to run a query.
    Uses statistics, index cardinality, join order, index selectivity.

4. What is the difference between EXISTS vs IN vs JOIN? Which is faster?
    Use EXISTS for correlated subqueries.
    IN loads a full result set.
    JOIN can outperform both, but may return duplicate rows if not handled.

5. How do you detect slow queries?
    Enable and inspect the slow query log.
    Use EXPLAIN, ANALYZE, or performance_schema for deep profiling.

6. How would you optimize a slow query?
    Use EXPLAIN to analyze execution plan.
    Add proper indexes, rewrite joins, eliminate filesort, reduce temp tables.
    Denormalize if necessary for heavy-read systems.





üìä Data Modeling & Design

7. How do you design a schema for multi-language support?
    Option 1: Translation tables per entity.
    Option 2: JSON columns.
    Option 3: EAV (use cautiously).

8. How would you handle large volumes of data (e.g., logs, events)?
    Use partitioning, sharding, archival strategies.
    Use InnoDB compression, or migrate to OLAP systems if needed.

9. What is database normalization? When would you denormalize?
    Normalize for data integrity.
    Denormalize when performance and read speed matter more than write duplication.





üîê Transactions & Concurrency

10. What is the difference between READ COMMITTED and REPEATABLE READ?
    READ COMMITTED: No dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads can happen.
    REPEATABLE READ: No dirty or non-repeatable reads; uses MVCC to provide consistent snapshots.

11. Explain deadlocks. How can you prevent or detect them?
    Deadlocks occur when two transactions wait on each other.
    Prevent by consistent locking order, smaller transactions, or deadlock detection logs.

12. What is MVCC in InnoDB?
    Multi-Version Concurrency Control.
    Lets readers work without blocking writers, by providing snapshots of data.





üìÅ Indexing & Query Internals
13. How does MySQL use composite indexes?
    Order matters. Index on (a, b) can be used for queries with:
    WHERE a = ?
    WHERE a = ? AND b = ?
    ‚ùå Not WHERE b = ? alone

14. What are common index pitfalls?
    Index on low-cardinality columns (like is_active)
    Over-indexing (hurts write performance)
    Not using prefix indexes for long VARCHAR





üîê Security & Access
15. How would you secure MySQL in a production environment?
    Use strong auth, least privilege access, SSL/TLS, disable remote root login, monitor logs.





üí• Stored Procedures & Triggers
16. Pros and cons of using stored procedures?
    Pros:
        Encapsulation
        Faster for repetitive tasks
        Less network latency
    Cons:
        Harder to version control
        Debugging is painful
        Less flexible than application logic

17. What are BEFORE vs AFTER triggers?
    BEFORE: Run before insert/update/delete ‚Äî can modify data
    AFTER: Run after ‚Äî good for logging or chaining





üì¶ Partitioning & Scaling
18. What is partitioning? When do you use it?
    Splits large tables into parts for better performance.
    Useful for time-series data or very large datasets.
    Types: RANGE, LIST, HASH, KEY

19. How would you scale MySQL?
    Vertical scaling (more CPU/RAM)
    Read replicas for read scaling
    Sharding for write scaling
    Use a proxy layer like ProxySQL for routing





üß™ Advanced Query Writing
20. Write a query to get the second highest salary in a table.
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

21. How do you calculate running totals using SQL?
    (If MySQL 8+ supports window functions)
    SELECT name, salary, 
    SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS running_total
    FROM employees;
