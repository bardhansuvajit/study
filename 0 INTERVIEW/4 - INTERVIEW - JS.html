===================================================================================================
===================*************** 🔹 Core JavaScript (ES6+) ***************======================
===================================================================================================

VAR vs LET vs CONST
    var - function-scoped variables, that can be hoisted. Can be redeclared and updated
    let - block scoped variables, that can be reassigned, cannot be hoisted. Can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.
    const - block scoped variables, that are constant & cannot be reassigned, cannot be hoisted. Cannot be redeclared or reassigned (but object/array properties can be modified).


What are closures? How do they work?
    Closure allows inner functions to access the outer scope of a function. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
    EXAMPLE
        function outer() {
            let x = 10;
            return function inner() {
                console.log(x); // Remembers 'x' even after outer() finishes
            };
        }
        const closureFn = outer();
        closureFn(); // Output: 10


What is hoisting and how does it affect variable/function declarations?
    Move all variables and function declarations to the top of current scope. 
    Functions are hoisted first, then variables. Functions are fully hoisted whereas, variables are partially. Variables are set as undefined first.

    var is hoisted and initialized as undefined
    With let and const, you get a ReferenceError


What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in JavaScript?
    Shallow Copy: Copies top-level properties, but nested objects are still referenced.
        Methods: Object.assign(), spread operator (...).
    Deep Copy: Creates a completely independent copy (including nested objects).
        Methods: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)), libraries like Lodash.
    EXAMPLE
        const obj = { a: 1, nested: { b: 2 } };
        const shallowCopy = { ...obj }; // nested is shared
        const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); // Fully independent


Explain event delegation and its advantages.
    when you attach a single event listener to a parent, and use event.target to handle child interactions.
    EXAMPLE
        document.getElementById('list').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
            if (e.target.tagName === 'LI') {
                console.log('Clicked:', e.target.textContent);
            }
        });


What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?
    The TDZ is the time between entering a block and the actual declaration of a let or const variable — where accessing it throws a ReferenceError.
    console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError
    let a = 10;


What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
    == (Loose Equality): Checks value after type coercion (e.g., 5 == "5" → true).
    === (Strict Equality): Checks value and type (e.g., 5 === "5" → false).


What are higher-order functions? Give examples.
    Functions that take a function as an argument and/or return a function.
    EXAMPLE
        // 1. Accepts function
        function higherOrder(callback) {
            callback();
        }
        // 2. Returns function
        function multiplier(factor) {
            return (x) => x * factor;
        }
        // Built-in examples: map(), filter(), reduce()


Explain JavaScript prototypal inheritance.
    Objects inherit properties/methods from a prototype (a template object).
    EXAMPLE
        function Person(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        Person.prototype.greet = function() { console.log(`Hi, ${this.name}`); };
        const john = new Person("John");
        john.greet(); // Inherits from Person.prototype


Difference between call, apply, and bind.
    All three change this context for a function:

    call: Invokes immediately, takes arguments individually.
    func.call(context, arg1, arg2);

    apply: Invokes immediately, takes arguments as an array.
    func.apply(context, [arg1, arg2]);

    bind: Returns a new function with bound this (does not invoke immediately).
    const boundFn = func.bind(context);
    boundFn();








===================================================================================================
===================*************** 🔹 Asynchronous JavaScript ***************======================
===================================================================================================

XML in AJAX
    AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
    Initially, AJAX used XML to send/receive structured data from the server without reloading the page.
    Example: A browser sends a request, the server responds with XML data, JavaScript reads it using the XMLHttpRequest object.
    ✅ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has mostly replaced XML because:


What is the event loop? Explain with examples.
    EVENT LOOP checks if the callstack is empty & entire JS file is read once & if its empty, it pushes it into 'Call Stack'
    simply monitors the call stack & the callback queue
    HOW DOES IT WORK
        1. JS runs synchronously first (line by line).
        2. Async functions (like setTimeout, Promises, etc.) are handed off to the Web APIs (handled by browser/Node.js).
        3. The Call Stack executes all synchronous code and becomes empty.
        4. Then 
            Microtasks (Promises etc.) go to the Microtask Queue
            Macrotasks (timeouts etc.) go to the Task Queue
        4. Then Event Loop checks:
            "Is the Call Stack empty?"
        5. If yes, then runs:
            → ALL microtasks
            → ONE macrotask
            → ALL microtasks again
            → NEXT macrotask
            → ...
    Why It Runs “ALL microtasks again”:
        Because microtasks can be added at any time, especially from inside a macrotask.


What are microtasks and macrotasks in the event loop?
    Microtasks >>   Promise.then, queueMicrotask. Executed first (before next render)
    Macrotasks >>   setTimeout, setInterval, I/O. Executed after all microtasks


Difference between Promise.then, async/await, and callbacks.
    | Feature        | Callbacks              | Promises (`.then`)  | `async/await`                |
    | -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | Syntax         | Function in function   | Chainable `.then()` | Syntactic sugar for Promises |
    | Readability    | Harder (callback hell) | Better              | Best (linear style)          |
    | Error handling | Try/catch hard         | `.catch()`          | `try/catch` easily           |
    | Control Flow   | Nested logic           | Chainable flow      | Top-down flow                |


How does Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.allSettled work?

What is a race condition and how do you prevent it in async JS code?
    A race condition occurs when multiple async operations depend on shared data, and the outcome depends on timing.
    EXAMPLE PROBLEM
        let loggedIn = false;
        fetch('/login').then(() => {
            loggedIn = true;
        });
        fetch('/logout').then(() => {
            loggedIn = false;
        });






===================================================================================================
==========================*************** 🔹 DOM & BOM ***************=============================
===================================================================================================

How does the DOM event propagation work? (capture, target, bubble)
    DOM Event Propagation is the process that determines the order in which event handlers are called when an event (like a click) happens on nested HTML elements.
    It happens in 3 phases:
        1. Capturing Phase/ Capture/ Trickle Down
            The event starts from the root (window/document) and goes down the DOM tree to the target element.
            If you attach an event listener with { capture: true }, it runs during this phase.
        2. Target Phase
            The event reaches the target element (the one that was actually clicked or interacted with).
            Handlers on this element are run.
        3. Bubbling Phase/ Bubble Up
            After the event hits the target, it bubbles back up the DOM tree from the target to the root.
            By default, most event listeners trigger in this phase.
    EXAMPLE
        <div id="outer">
            <button id="inner">Click Me</button>
        </div>

        <script>
            outer.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("outer"), true); // capture
            inner.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("inner"));       // bubble
        </script>

    OUTPUT
        outer inner
        ✅ outer runs first because it's in capture phase,
        ✅ inner runs in the bubbling phase.
    You can control event flow using:
        event.stopPropagation() → stops further propagation.
        event.preventDefault() → prevents default browser behavior.


How do you optimize DOM manipulation for performance?
    DOM manipulation is how you make dynamic changes to a web page after it loads.
    OPTIMIZE
        Store DOM references in variables (  const button = document.querySelector("#btn");  )
        Group multiple changes together instead of one by one.
        Libraries like React use a Virtual DOM to reduce direct DOM updates.
        innerHTML is fast but re-renders everything inside — avoid using it often.
        Use textContent, or DOM methods (createElement, appendChild) for small changes.
        Use CSS animations/transitions instead of JavaScript-based animation when possible — they're optimized by the browser.


Explain the difference between document.querySelector and getElementById.
    getElementById() targets only id || Any valid CSS selector
    return type element/ null || first matching element
    getElementById() is slighty faster

===================*************** 🔹 Performance & Optimization ***************======================
======================================================================================================

What are memory leaks in JavaScript? How do you identify and fix them?
    create an infinite loop, that would fill up memory & browser will crash. as nothing is popped off the stack. 
    Common Memory Leaks
        1. Using too many GLOBAL VARIABLES, all our memory will get used up
        2. Keep adding EVENT LISTENERS, when using too many and not removed
        3. OBJECTS IN SETINTERVAL, they will never be garbage-collected, unless removed itself
    Remember, memory is limited. JS runs and stores memory in CALL STACK & MEMORY HEAP. Do not have STACK OVERFLOW & MEMORY LEAK
    How Do You Identify Memory Leaks?
        1. Watch for page freezing & alowing down
        2. Check DevTools -> Memory tab & take snapshot
        3. Look for Detached DOM Nodes - These are elements that were removed from the DOM but still exist in memory because something (like an event listener or closure) is referencing them.
    FIX
        1. Avoid Global Variables
