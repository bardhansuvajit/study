What is the difference between hasOne, belongsTo, hasMany, belongsToMany in Eloquent?
    | `hasOne`        | One-to-one, current model **owns** another. (e.g. User hasOne Profile)
    | `belongsTo`     | One-to-one, current model **belongs** to another. (e.g. Profile belongsTo User)
    | `hasMany`       | One-to-many, one model has multiple related. (e.g. User hasMany Posts)
    | `belongsToMany` | Many-to-many with pivot table. (e.g. User belongsToMany Roles)

Explain Laravel middleware and use cases.
    filter HTTP requests. 
    Use cases:
        Authentication check
        Blocking under maintenance
        Setting language or timezone
        Validating input globally

What's the difference between middleware and guards in Laravel?
    | Feature  | Middleware                             | Guards                                  |
    | -------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | Role     | General request filter                 | Handles **how** users are authenticated |
    | Layer    | Runs **around routes**                 | Runs **inside auth system**             |
    | Examples | `auth`, `throttle`, `cors`, `verified` | `web`, `api`, `sanctum`, `passport`     |

How do Laravel queues work?
    Laravel queues let you delay time-consuming tasks so your app feels fast.
    How it works:
        You dispatch a job (like sending email)
        Laravel adds it to a queue (DB, Redis, SQS, etc.)
        A queue worker picks it up in the background

What are service providers in Laravel?
    Service providers are the bootstrappers of a Laravel app.
    They register services, bind classes into the container, and configure packages.
    EXAMPLE
        Registering custom helper classes
        Binding interfaces to implementations
        Setting global configurations

What is the difference between Auth::user() and auth()->user()?
    | `Auth::user()`   | **Facade** based static access
    | `auth()->user()` | **Helper function**, more flexible and chainable

How does Laravel's IOC container work?
    Laravel's IoC (Inversion of Control) container is a system that manages class dependencies.
    WHAT IT DOES
        Automatically injects needed classes into controllers, jobs, etc.
        You define dependencies in constructors, Laravel resolves them.

How do you manage event-driven architecture in Laravel (events, listeners, queues)?
    Event = Something happened (e.g. UserRegistered)
    Listener = Handle what to do (e.g. SendWelcomeEmail)

    EXAMPLE
    php artisan make:event UserRegistered
    php artisan make:listener SendWelcomeEmail --event=UserRegistered


How does Laravel handle query caching or route caching?
    query caching
        $users = Cache::remember('active_users', 60, function () {
            return User::where('active', 1)->get();
        });
    route caching
        php artisan route:cache

What is facade
    facade is a shortcut to access a class or service in the Laravel service container
    ‚úÖ Common Laravel Facades:
        | `Cache`     | `Illuminate\Cache\CacheManager`       |
        | `DB`        | `Illuminate\Database\DatabaseManager` |
        | `Auth`      | `Illuminate\Auth\AuthManager`         |
        | `Route`     | `Illuminate\Routing\Router`           |
        | `Log`       | `Illuminate\Log\LogManager`           |
        | `Validator` | `Illuminate\Validation\Factory`       |


register || boot
    register() ‚Üí ‚ÄúSet up services‚Äù
    boot() ‚Üí ‚ÄúStart services once everything is ready‚Äù

How does Laravel's job batching and chaining work?
    Job Chaining
        Run multiple jobs one after another, in a defined order.
        The next job starts only after the previous one completes successfully.
        Bus::chain([
            new JobA,
            new JobB,
            new JobC,
        ])->dispatch();

    Job Batching
        Run multiple jobs in parallel as a batch.
        Bus::batch([
            new JobA,
            new JobB,
            new JobC,
        ])->then(fn() => Log::info('Batch complete'))->dispatch();


What is Horizon? When and why would you use it?
    Horizon is Laravel's dashboard for queue monitoring.
    Built-in UI to monitor jobs, failed jobs, throughput, etc.

How does Laravel's Gate differ from Policy?
    | Feature   | Gate                                | Policy                                                |
    | --------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | Purpose   | Simple, closure-based authorization | Organized, class-based authorization                  |
    | Usage     | Good for one-off checks             | Good for resource-based logic (like Post, User, etc.) |
    | Structure | Defined in `AuthServiceProvider`    | Each model gets its own Policy class                  |


What are Observer classes in Laravel and when do you use them?
    Observers let you hook into model lifecycle events like:
    creating, updating, deleted, restored, etc.
    EXAMPLE
        class UserObserver {
            public function creating(User $user) {
                $user->uuid = Str::uuid();
            }
        }
        // Register in service provider
        User::observe(UserObserver::class);


What's the role of app/Providers folder in Laravel?
    This folder contains Service Providers - classes that bootstrap and register parts of your application.


How does Laravel handle Dependency Injection?
    Laravel uses a powerful IoC (Inversion of Control) container:
        It automatically injects dependencies into classes or methods
        It resolves and provides the needed class by type-hinting


How do you write custom Artisan commands?
    Create custom command
        php artisan make:command SendReport
    Implement logic in app/Console/Commands/SendReport.php
        public function handle()
        {
            // code logic here
        }
    Laravel 11/ 12 auto register commands, if not register it in app/Console/Kernel.php


What are macros in Laravel and where can you define them?
    Macros allow you to extend Laravel classes (like Collections, Routes, etc.) with your own methods.
    Response::macro('caps', fn($value) => Response::make(strtoupper($value)));
    You can define them in:
        A Service Provider
        A custom MacroServiceProvider


How do you create a custom validation rule?
    Generate
        php artisan make:rule Uppercase
    Logic
        public function passes($attribute, $value)
        {
            return strtoupper($value) === $value;
        }
    use in validation
        $request->validate([
            'name' => ['required', new Uppercase]
        ]);


Repository Pattern in Laravel
    separate business logic from data access logic
    üîé What is the Repository Pattern?
        A repository acts like a mediator between your models (data layer) and the controllers or services (business logic layer). It hides the actual implementation of data access, whether it's Eloquent, Query Builder, raw SQL, external APIs, or anything else.
    üß† Why Use the Repository Pattern?
        Keeps your controller/service logic clean by separating database logic.
        Easy to swap Eloquent with API, MongoDB, or another source without changing business logic.
        Shared logic like filters, pagination, etc. can be reused across the app.
    üõ†Ô∏è When Should You Use It?
        Your app is large or growing in complexity.
        You want to follow clean architecture or DDD (Domain-Driven Design).
        You want reusable queries (e.g., custom filters used across many controllers).
    üßë‚Äçüíª How to Implement It in Laravel
        Step 1: Create an Interface
            // app/Interfaces/PostInterface.php
            namespace App\Interfaces;
            interface PostInterface
            {
                public function all();
                public function find($id);
                public function create(array $data);
                public function update($id, array $data);
                public function delete($id);
            }
        Step 2: Create the Repository Class
            // app/Repositories/PostRepository.php
            namespace App\Repositories;
            use App\Models\Post;
            class PostRepository implements PostRepositoryInterface
            {
                public function all()
                {
                    return Post::all();
                }
                public function find($id)
                {
                    return Post::findOrFail($id);
                }
                ...
            }
        Step 3: Bind Interface to Implementation
            // app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
            public function register()
            {
                $this->app->bind(
                    \App\Interfaces\PostInterface::class,
                    \App\Repositories\PostRepository::class
                );
            }
        Step 4: Use It in a Controller or Service

===================================================================================================

How do you use route caching, config caching, and view caching?
    php artisan route:cache
    php artisan config:cache
    php artisan view:cache


How does Laravel's query builder compare with raw SQL in performance?
    Laravel's Query Builder                 | Raw SQL
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Safer (prevents SQL injection)          | Slightly faster (no abstraction)
    More readable                           | Less readable and harder to maintain
    Slightly slower due to abstraction      | Use when performance is critical or for complex queries


How do you prevent N+1 problems in Laravel?
    N+1 = When you run one query to get records, and N queries to get their relations
    FIX: Use Eager Loading
    Example (Bad - N+1):
        $posts = Post::all();
        foreach ($posts as $post) {
            echo $post->author->name;               // causes N queries
        }
    Example (Good - Eager load):
        $posts = Post::with('author')->get();       // 1 query


How would you optimize large Eloquent queries?
    Use select() to fetch only needed columns
    Use chunk() or cursor() for large datasets
    Use indexes on commonly filtered columns
    Use whereHas(), withCount() for relations efficiently
    Avoid unnecessary relations or deep nesting
    Consider caching results


What tools can you use to profile a Laravel application?
    Laravel Debugbar (local dev)
    Clockwork
    Telescope (detailed insights into requests, queries, etc.)
    Xdebug + profiler
    Blackfire.io (production-grade profiler)
    Laravel Telescope (official, great for queues, mail, jobs)


What is the difference between eager loading, lazy loading, and lazy eager loading?
    1 LAZY LOADING
        Loads relation when you access it, one-by-one ‚Äî can cause N+1 issues.
            $posts = Post::all();
            foreach ($posts as $post) {
                echo $post->user->name;
            }
        What happens here:
            Laravel runs 1 query to fetch all posts.
            Then for each post, it runs another query to get the user (so, N more queries).
            If you have 100 posts, it runs 101 queries total ‚Äî this is the N+1 query problem.
    2 EAGER LOADING
        Loads everything upfront, with JOIN-like queries, before you access it.
            $posts = Post::with('user')->get();
            foreach ($posts as $post) {
                echo $post->user->name;
            }
        What happens here:
            Laravel runs 2 queries:
            One to get all posts
            One to get all the users for those posts
            Efficient ‚Äî no matter how many posts, just 2 queries total
    3 LAZY EAGER LOADING
        First load the parents, then load relations later, all at once.
            $posts = Post::where('category', 'News')->get();
            // Later in code
            $posts->load('user');
            foreach ($posts as $post) {
                echo $post->user->name;
            }
        What happens here:
            1st query: get the posts
            2nd query (from load()): get all users for those posts
            üß† Useful when:
                You didn't eager load at the beginning
                You decide to load relations dynamically later


How can you cache database results effectively in Laravel?
    $users = Cache::remember('active_users', 60, function () {
        return User::where('active', 1)->get();
    });

===================================================================================================
=================*************** üîê Security & Best Practices ***************===================
===================================================================================================

How do you protect against SQL injection in Laravel?
    Laravel uses PDO prepared statements by default, which automatically escape input.
    User::where('email', $email)->first();
    OR
    DB::select('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [$email]);


What are CSRF tokens and how does Laravel handle them?
    CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is when an attacker tricks a user into submitting unwanted actions.
    Laravel protects your app by:
        Automatically adding a CSRF token to each form.
        Verifying the token on POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests.


How do you securely manage .env files and sensitive configs?
    .env should never be committed to Git ‚Äî use .gitignore.
    On production, use server-level env variables or deploy-time secrets.
    Use config caching (php artisan config:cache) for performance and consistency.
    Laravel reads sensitive values via env() only inside config files.
    Use config('services.mailgun.key') in app logic ‚Äî not env() directly.


What is form request validation? How is it better than validating inside controllers?
    Form Request Validation moves validation logic to a dedicated class.
        php artisan make:request StoreUserRequest
        Then in StoreUserRequest.php >>
            public function rules()
            {
                return ['email' => 'required|email|unique:users'];
            }
        In Controller
            public function store(StoreUserRequest $request)
            {
                // Validated already!
            }
        ‚úÖ Cleaner controllers, reusable rules, better organization.


What are the best practices for handling file uploads?
    Use the store() or storeAs() methods with validation:
        $request->validate(['avatar' => 'required|image|max:2048']);
        $path = $request->file('avatar')->store('avatars');
    Store outside public folder (e.g., storage/app) and use symlink (php artisan storage:link) for access.
    Rename files using hashName() to avoid overwriting.
    Scan MIME types, not just extensions.
    ‚úÖ Store paths in the database, not the actual file contents.


How would you encrypt and decrypt data in Laravel?
    Laravel uses AES-256 encryption with a secure key from .env (APP_KEY).
    ENCRYPT
        $encrypted = encrypt('secret data');
    DECRYPT
        $decrypted = decrypt($encrypted);


What's the role of Laravel Sanctum and Passport?
    Both are used for API authentication, but serve different use cases:
    üîê Sanctum:
        Best for SPA or mobile APIs
        Lightweight
        Uses token-based auth or cookie-based auth
        Easy setup
    üîê Passport:
        Full OAuth2 implementation
        Best when dealing with third-party apps, scopes, or token authorization servers
        More complex
