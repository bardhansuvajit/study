=================*************** üîß Core PHP & Language Concepts ***************===================
===================================================================================================

PHP parser
    part of PHP inetrpreter, that reads PHP codes, breaks it (into Tokens), understand sturcture, then sends to interpreter/ compiler to execute

AST
    Abstract syntax tree, shows logical part of code. NOT what we typed, but what it means
    e.g. echo 2 + 3 >>> ECHO, ADD, NUMBER, 2, NUMBER, 3

== vs ===
    checks value vs checks value & type

Variable scoping
    Global: Declared outside functions.
    Local: Declared inside functions.
    Static: Retains value between function calls with static keyword.

inlcude || require
    error handling - gives warning if file not found (script execution continues) || gives fatal error (script execution stops)
    use case - file optional || file required

unset || unlink
    destroys variable || deletes file from filesystem

Call by Value || Call by Reference
    passes copy of the variable, keeping the original unchanged || passes the actual variable, allowing modification
    e.g. $a = 1; $b = $a; $b = 2; echo $a; > 1
    e.g. $a = 1; $b = &$a; $b = 2; echo $a; > 2

** ERROR TYPES
    notices     - non critical. user cant see these. e.g. undefined variable
    warnings    - important than notice. script execution is not interrupted. user can see. e.g. include() does not have a file
    syntax/ parsing error   - php parser is unable to execute. e.g. missing semicolon/ quote mark/ parenthesis
    fatal       - script execution immediately terminated. e.g. accessing non existing object property
to see errors in php.ini set, ini_set('display_errors', 1)
then include error_reporting(E_ALL) in all pages

MVC
    when user visits an url, https://example.com/products/show/1 > 
    router analyzes the URL & sends request to CONTROLLER
    CONTROLLER asks MODEL for data & handles request
    MODEL fetches data from DB
    then VIEW displays output

** Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent ---- WHY THIS HAPPENS & HOW TO SOLVE ?
    in PHP, header(), setcookie(), session_start() must be called before any output sent to browser
        1 e.g.
        echo "Welcome!";
        header("Location: dashboard.php");  // ‚ùå Warning here
        2 e.g.
        ‚ê£<?php
        header("Location: login.php");  // ‚ùå Warning, There's a space before <?php on the first line
        3 e.g.
        include 'header.php';  // this might output HTML or whitespace
        header("Location: profile.php");  // ‚ùå Warning

    SOLUTION
        1. No output before header()
        2. Check for whitespace or blank lines
        3. Use output buffering, allows PHP to delay output until all headers are sent:
            <?php
                ob_start();  // Start output buffering
                header("Location: next.php");  // Safe even if there's echo after this
                ob_end_flush(); // Send output at the end
            ?>

$i = 016;
echo $i / 2; OUTPUT ?
    Numbers that start with 0 are interpreted as octal

Closure
    anonymous functions (function without name) to capture variable from its surrounding scope using the use keyword.
    e.g.
        $prefix = "Hi";
        $sayHello = function($name) use ($prefix) {
            return "$prefix, $name!";
        };
        echo $sayHello("Suvajit"); // Output: Hi, Suvajit!

isset() || empty() || is_null()
    isset() for existence check, empty() for blank checks, and is_null() for null-specific logic.

Garbage Collection
    manage memory by cleaning up unused objects or circular references that are no longer accessible.
    PROBLEM
        Variables in PHP keep track of how many references point to it. When variable is unset, the count decreses. If the reference count drops to zero, PHP frees the memory immediately. 
        But freeing up memory is not easy like this, MEMORY LEAK happens when 2 variables reference each other, even when unset, memory won't be free
    SOLUTION
        PHP solves this using a cyclic garbage collector, which:
            Detects circular references (When 2 variables reference each other, memory could never be free making Memory Leak)
            Uses "Root Buffer" to track possible cycles
            Periodically collects and frees them using gc_collect_cycles();
    Garbage Collection in PHP is automatic. But to tune performance we can manually manage
        gc_enable();             // Turn GC back on
        gc_disable();            // Turn GC off
        gc_collect_cycles();     // Force collection now
        gc_enabled();            // Check if it's on
        gc_status();             // See stats 

Magic Methods
    Special methods like __construct, __get, __set, __call, etc.
    They enable object lifecycle management, dynamic method/property access, and custom behavior (e.g., serialization, cloning).

==========================================================================================
=================*************** üß± OOP & Architecture ***************===================
==========================================================================================

pillars of OOP. with Examples

SOLID principle
    acronym for 5 principles of object-oriented design.
    S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
        A single class should have a single responsibility.
        e.g.
            class UserManager {
                public function createUser() { ... }
                public function sendWelcomeEmail() { ... } // Email logic doesn't belong here
            }
    O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
        Classes should be opened for extension (add new features by extending the existing code), closed for modification (dont change existing code that is already working)
        e.g.
            // ‚ùå Without OCP
            class Payment {
                public function pay($type, $amount) {
                    if ($type === 'paypal') {
                        // PayPal logic
                    } elseif ($type === 'stripe') {
                        // Stripe logic
                    }
                    // what if we add Razorpay? keep editing this üò´
                }
            }
            ‚úÖ With OCP ‚Äî Flexible Design Using Interface
            interface PaymentMethod {
                public function pay($amount);
            }
            class Paypal implements PaymentMethod {
                public function pay($amount) {
                    echo "Paying ‚Çπ$amount via PayPal";
                }
            }
            class Stripe implements PaymentMethod {
                public function pay($amount) {
                    echo "Paying ‚Çπ$amount via Stripe";
                }
            }
            // Now, if you want to add Razorpay:
            class Razorpay implements PaymentMethod {
                public function pay($amount) {
                    echo "Paying ‚Çπ$amount via Razorpay";
                }
            }
    L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
        Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes. If class B is a subclass of A, you should be able to use B anywhere A is expected ‚Äî without breaking the app.
        e.g.
            class Bird {
                public function fly() {}
            }
            class Eagle extends Bird {
                public function fly() { echo \"Flying\"; }
            }
            ‚úÖ Eagle behaves like a Bird.
            ‚ùå If Penguin extends Bird but can't fly ‚Üí LSP is broken.
    I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
        Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they don't use. Prefer many small interfaces over one big one.
        e.g.
            ‚ùå Bad:
            interface Worker {
                public function work();
                public function eat();
            }
            ‚úÖ Good:
            interface Workable { public function work(); }
            interface Eatable { public function eat(); }

            class Human implements Workable, Eatable {}
            class Robot implements Workable {}

    D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
        Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes. Instead of hardcoding dependencies, rely on interfaces.
        e.g.
            ‚ùå Bad:
            class OrderService {
                public function __construct() {
                    $this->payment = new Paypal(); // tightly coupled
                }
            }
            ‚úÖ Good:
            class OrderService {
                public function __construct(PaymentMethod $payment) {
                    $this->payment = $payment;
                }
            }

** TRAIT
    traits allow to use resuable code in laguage like PHP where multiple inheritance is not supported
    e.g. // ‚ùå ERROR: Cannot extend multiple classes
    class C extends A, B { ... }
    class C {
        use Logger, Notifier;
        ...
    }

** Dependency Injection
    A design pattern where one object gives another object the things it needs (its dependencies) ‚Äî instead of making the object create them itself.
    e.g.
        class UserController {
            private $service;

            // ‚ùå Without Dependency Injection (Tightly Coupled)
            public function __construct() {
                $this->service = new UserService();
            }

            // ‚úÖ With Dependency Injection (Loosely Coupled)
            public function __construct(UserService $service) {
                $this->service = $service;
            }

            public function show() {
                return $this->service->getUser();
            }
        }

==============*************** üõ°Ô∏è Security ***************=================
==========================================================================

** What are SQL Injections, how do you prevent them and what are the best practices?
    a security vulnerability where a malicious user can inject arbitary SQL code into query - potentially giving them access to, or control over, your database.
    Example of a Vulnerable PHP Code:
        <?php
            $username = $_GET['username'];
            $password = $_GET['password'];

            $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";
            $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
        ?>

        NOW, If someone enters this in the URL:
        ?username=admin' --&password=anything

        It becomes:
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything'
        The -- starts a comment, so the password part is ignored
        The attacker can log in as admin without a password

    Prevention
        1. Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)
            mysqli >
                $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
                $stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password);
                $stmt->execute();
            pdo >
                $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password = :password");
                $stmt->execute(['username' => $username, 'password' => $password]);
        2. Validate and Sanitize User Input
            $username = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'username', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
